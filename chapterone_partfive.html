<h3>Recommending Practices for Writing Studies, Turning to Independent Game Developers</h3>

<p>Setting the stage for the rest of the book, this chapter has covered three areas of rhetorical practice that have been deeply felt by creators of webtexts: collaboration, revision, and delivery. So how might scholarly creators, including authors and editors, support and share their experiences such practices and associated feelings in a digital media production cycle? In closing this chapter, I propose three low-stakes approaches that apply to editors and authors, with the understanding that such approaches are contingent on factors such as time, departmental resources, and comfort (with sharing work in public). Signaling the chapters that follow this one, I also close by suggesting we also turn to independent game developers, who often put themselves in more vulnerable positions yet advance their creative visions and engage with vibratory affects in collaborative and lively public settings.  While my focus in this chapter has been on webtexts, I see applicability to print-based texts and their authors, for their rhetorical-affective work is significant to understanding scholarly production writ large. Again, without pulling together scholars and conveying our practices and feelings in some way, we who get published are guarding valuable information for aspiring scholars and those who archive our field’s production histories.</p>  
<p>As a field, how do we support living digital media? How do we ensure creators don't lose momentum on their webtexts in progress?</p>  
<p>First, to support collaboration and formative feedback, writing studies journal editors and published authors ought to create more low-stakes workshops and professional development gatherings that reflect the approaches of the Dartmouth Summer Writing Research Seminar, Digital Media and Composition Institute, and KairosCamp. Held when many schools begin summer break, for example, DMAC at The Ohio State University hosts teachers and practitioners in English studies and beyond who want to sharpen their digital media composing practices. Situated in the department of English, DMAC participants create audio and visual texts and consult with experienced teacher-scholars and graduate students. Participants in 2018 paid $1,900 to attend on a first-come, first-served basis. I was there, fortunate enough to have received a grant from my graduate school to attend. Similarly, KairosCamp is a professional development workshop created by Cheryl Ball, co-editor of <cite>Kairos</cite>. Supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and West Virginia University’s Digital Publishing Institute, recent KairosCamps spanned two weeks in a university space. Writing studies, history, media studies, and social science scholars conceptualized and workshopped webtexts and digital humanities projects. Participants applied to attend KairosCamp, for which participation and lodging was provided free of charge (“About”). DMAC and KairosCamp have indeed been useful for scholars not previously trained in composing digital media scholarship.</p>   
<p> However, the problem with summer institutes like Dartmouth, DMAC, and KairosCamp is that they serve students and professors with means of funding support or extended travel. In other words, the embodied intensities of collaboration are limited to field members who can afford it. DMAC’s website has archived past schedules and resources amassed over the years (see “SCHEDULE”), while KairosCamp has an archive of its 2017 author workshop (see “Author Workshop Archive”). These archives might be useful for aspiring authors, but I think organizers of future institutes and workshops can address funding and travel barriers even further. When participants are rejected or unable to attend for financial, geographic or health reasons, hosts might later amass a list of potential participants and help facilitate a peer network in an online setting. Help people find other people for technical, rhetorical, and emotional support. Help facilitate horizontal mentorship, for print- or digital-centric publications, an opportunity to air out worries and doubts about work. Similarly, hosts might consider creating online equivalents to such online institutes. Together with a document-sharing platform like Google Docs, video-conference platforms have made synchronous and asynchronous collaboration quite accessible for authors. A video archive of a scholarly production workshop might be enormously useful for an aspiring author. My point: We need to explore more ways to get people together or in contact with writing studies’ peers, editors, and leaders of scholarly production.</p> 

<p>[Media to be placed]</p> 
<p>Secondly, the stories of this chapter hold implications for the circulatory review practices of digital media scholarship, and I call on editors considers ways to streamline the review process. Creators such as Brooke and Ian and Nick conveyed lengthy review letters than were more than 10 pages, perhaps because <cite>Kairos</cite> allows the senior editors and the entire review board to comment on submissions&mdash;rather than assigning, say, two board members/external experts to a text. A similar process occurs with manuscripts submitted to university of Michigan’s Digital Rhetoric Collaborative, which has a substantial review board (https://www.digitalrhetoriccollaborative.org/book-prize/) of notable scholars. In contrast, Eric and Grace received feedback from two reviewers for their <cite>Computers and Composition Online</cite> piece, working from a few pages submitted by the two. There is a tension here between these two review processes that we ought to address. It's an understatement that <cite>Kairos'</cite> review process enacts lively circulation before Circulation because a submission courses through numerous editors and reviewers before it returns to the author(s). The process ensures that authors get feedback from a range of perspectives, like a usability testing session or focus group. It's also inclusive and open-ended for the review board, allowing reviewers to respond as interested. Echoing Kathleen Stewart's (2007) meditations of affect, however, I see this review process as one that sparks a strong electrical charge of mixed feelings (uncertainty, joy) that linger in circulation for weeks and months. And when more reviewers are involved, there are potentially more opportunities for that review process to leak out in social realms (e.g., Brooke's discussion with "Mr. Guy"). Perhaps the charge is too strong, too much, for prospective authors. They are sharing their work and their name is all over it. The process isn’t anonymous, and neither are reviewers. As <cite>Kairos</cite> writes, "When submitting to the journal, there is no need to attempt to remove information about the author(s) or institutions referenced in the work. Reviewers will know authors' names, and likewise, authors will know who reviewed their work." Well-respected names in the field are living digital media with authors.  Following this metaphor a bit further, perhaps publications with large review boards need to dial down the voltage a bit by asking select reviewers to comment on a project. </p> 
<p>I'm not suggesting that journals that welcome webtexts turn to the typical review process of scholarship. Inviting three or four reviewers to comment would likely be more than enough assessment for authors to consider as they revise.  If <cite>Kairos</cite> and other journals opt to maintain review processes like the aforementioned, then perhaps a synthesis letter alone is enough for authors to consider.  Furthermore, substantial review processes might feel as lively but less overwhelming if editors invite 1-1 meetings with authors on recently reviewed submissions. Brooke’s case demonstrates the value of <cite>Kairos</cite>"Tier 3" process, in which a mentor is assigned to an author after their submission has been reviewed by the board. <cite>Kairos</cite>and fellow journals have also offered virtual open houses and Q&A meetings for prospective authors, especially those in the early stages of a project. What about meeting with authors who go through their first Tier 1 and Tier 2? These mid-tier conversations might help authors decode the feedback and feel less overwhelmed by the many words before them. This approach would run counter to the arms-length, revise-and-resubmit expectations of scholarship in general, but given the labour-intensive nature of digital media scholarship, this approach might help streamline the next revision without compromising it. I turn to Brooke's mentor's advice: Paragraphs don’t need to be long; they need to be concise. Don’t lose sight of the data and what the students were saying. “And that stuff seems really obvious but when you’ve been embroiled in this piece for four years, it’s really easy to lose sight of it; it’s really easy to get caught up in just addressing what the reviewers say” (Brooke; emphasis added).</p>
<p>Lastly, to reveal myriad approaches to collaboration and feedback, I call on more writing studies scholars to deliver process statements, behind-the-scenes stories, and even archivable ephemera (see Ostergaard and Nugent, 2019) that accompany or follow their scholarly publications. As demonstrated by Crystal VanKooten (2016) and David Sheridan (2015), behind-the-scenes stories foreground unseen and affective work&mdash;such as tools and bodies that render rhetorical practices and contribute to felt experiences. What did we struggle with in our production? What was challenging? Who and what supported our work? As Selfe and Hawisher (2012) found in interviews with composers, stories provide “glimpses of the challenges with which participants struggled when they sought access to technology or assistance in learning to use technology but also tacit and often unconscious acts of world making” (p. 39; emphasis added). Stories are akin to acknowledgements of writing partners, or “animals, feelings, technologies, matter, time, and materials interacting in both harmonious and antagonistic ways with writing” (Micciche, p. 6). To put Shipka and Micciche in conversation, behind-the-scenes stories of making would help scholars and students identify human and nonhuman partners that contribute, for better or worse, to digital and print-based writing productions. By and large, stories in the form of process statements might serve well as rhetorical-affective repositories for future authors and teachers who mentor such authors.</p>
<p>I understand that composing a complementary statement on a production comes down to more time and labor for a text already completed. But those of us who have the know-how and privilege to see a production through would support the field by showing their work, even to a small extent. I am not referring to a full webtext like those in the “Inventio” series but rather a few hundred words that discuss a production and its challenges. A short statement is a low-stakes approach to meeting the original goals of “Inventio,” intended to be “a forum for discussing production choices that have gone on behind the scenes, in essence allowing authors to guide the interpretation of their work by highlighting the hows and whys of its creation” (Sorapure and Stolley, 2007, “Introducing Inventio”). Here are two examples of what I mean by a low-stakes approach. In his webtext “Instagram, Geocaching, and the When of Rhetorical Literacies,” Brian McNely (2015) offers a note about its design:</p> 
<blockquote>As a scrolling, responsive site, this webtext directly supports the central claims of the academic argument, to wit: rhetorical literacies unfold in trajectories and continua of everyday practice. . . . In addition, the photographic interludes between sections are liminal spaces in the webtext, representing the liminal spaces of a geocacher’s world.</blockquote>
<p>A scrolling, responsive webtext. Photos. We know a little more about what McNely is doing. In “Looking in the Dustbin: Data Janitorial Work, Statistical Reasoning, and Information Rhetorics,” Aaron Beveridge (2015) writes that he created an infographic with the website easel.ly and drafted his webtext with Markdown, Pandoc, and GitHub. “GitHub also provides the free hosting as well&mdash;including images. For collaborative web-publishing, GitHub is a fantastic resource.” This kind of process writing that accompanies the final delivery of a webtext might help aspiring authors make better decisions when selecting tools and creating designs, especially if they feel lost on how to get started. It might also help review boards and tenure and promotion committees better understand and appreciate the lively circulation of rhetorical-affective practices that make a webtext possible. And these shouldn’t be exclusive to digital publications; future authors and reviewers of <cite>College English</cite>, <cite>Rhetoric Review</cite>, and <cite>College Composition and Communication</cite> would learn something valuable through the study of brief statements that accompany or follow articles.</p>  
<p>I anticipate that some will take issue with my suggested approaches regarding workshops and statements. My research participant Eric, for example, spoke of the pleasure of losing track of time when composing his webtext. There might be good feelings entangled with building a webtext organically, in losing oneself in the assemblages of content writing, design, and code, or stepping in the mist of emotions of confusion, frustration, and wonder in order to forge a new digital draft. In <cite>Technologies of Wonder</cite>, Susan Delagrange (2011) argues against simple design prescriptions and reductive suggestions for digital media. Wonder, in her words, is significant for material, embodied production: “In digital media, the piling up of print, image, sound, pattern, movement, and association can be as unsettling as the juxtaposition of flowered wallpaper and the Brooklyn Bridge&mdash;and as potentially productive” (p. 175). She goes on: “Rhetorical techné is mobile and strategic. It does not conform itself to already-made discursive space and subjectivity; it shapes its discursive and embodied form and content in response to the kairos of the moment” (p. 175). Considering her view of digital media production, I recognize that calling more attention to HTML5, Creative Commons templates, and process narratives might close off certain rhetorical avenues of wonder for scholars. Lane, for example, learned a great deal about his digital media composing practices by scrapping a project and drafting a new one. His initial failure was more than potentially productive&mdash;that emotional moment of getting rejected by reviewers was a gateway to what would be an exciting collaborative digital monograph that he coauthored with two senior scholars. Allow me to reframe Lane’s experience through the words of Collin Brooke and Allison Carr (2015): “Failure [and thus success] is one of the most valuable abilities a writer can possess. The ability to [compose digital media scholarship] well comes neither naturally nor easily; the thinkers we praise and admire are not the lucky few born with innate talent” (p. 63).</p> 
<p>Still, if the field wants more scholars to author digital media texts and articles, we need a healthy mix of free workshops, scholarly reflections, and organic compositions. We need more lifelines for authors who find themselves unable to escape developmental purgatory. Between organic invention and informal conversations, an author might find a way out.</p> 
<p>In closing, for the subsequent chapters of this book, I’m seeking to augment my aforementioned calls by turning to the rhetorical-affective practices of game developers. This book entwines stories of digital media creators&mdash;in both academia and the game development industry&mdash;to shed light on how creators are living digital media. These creators attend to a complicated mess of feelings inherent to digital media, such as the disappointment that imbues web design and the overwhelming joy that saturates beta testing. Thus, <cite>Living Digital Media</cite> looks to and beyond the disciplinary field in order to address the ways in which creators are experimenting with digital media and attending to feelings in circulation before and after Circulation. Because of this interdisciplinary approach, my primary audience, the field of rhetoric and writing studies, stands to gain new insights into digital media production.</p>
