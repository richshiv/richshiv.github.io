<p>On October 23, 2024, Mariel Garza resigned from her position as editor of the editorial pages at The Los Angeles Times. In an interview with the Columbia Journalism Review, she didn’t mince words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay<br>
with us being silent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her departure was followed by at least two other editorial board members, marking a public rupture between journalists and their employer over what could—and could not—be said. The Times owner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Soon-Shiong">Patrick Soon-Shiong</a>, had blocked the board’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, citing a desire for the paper to remain neutral. For Garza and her colleagues, this wasn’t neutrality; it was institutional silencing that violated their professional ethics and public responsibilities.</p>

<p>Just weeks later, a similar crisis unfolded at The Washington Post, where owner Jeff Bezos blocked the editorial board’s endorsement, triggering resignations and subscription cancellations. These weren’t isolated incidents of workplace disagreement—they were public performances of institutional pressure meeting rhetorical resistance. The journalists who resigned knew their departures would circulate across social media, generating commentary, criticism, and support from audiences far beyond their newsrooms. They composed their exits carefully: direct language, others’ more measured statements, all calibrated to communicate professional ethics while navigating employer relationships, public opinion, and future career prospects. They were, in every sense, pressurized rhetorical bodies.</p>
<p>These cases illuminate a phenomenon that extends far beyond journalism: high-profile individuals who create public-facing content—whether news articles, product reviews, athletic performances, or social media posts—increasingly find themselves caught between institutional expectations about what and how they should communicate and the demands of digital audiences who expect authenticity, accountability, and emotional labor. This book argues that understanding contemporary digital communication requires attending to this dual pressure, to the ways rhetorical bodies are simultaneously constrained by organizational “feeling rules” and provoked by “affective publics” online.</p>
<p>My own experience as a pressurized rhetorical body began years before social media amplified these tensions to their current intensity. From 2005 to 2007, I worked as a reporter for CiN Weekly, the Cincinnati Enquirer’s lifestyle publication. The editorial guidelines were clear: negative criticism was unwelcome across all sections—restaurants, bars, music, art. These weren’t written policies so much as enforced practices, feeling rules that shaped what I could write and how I could write it. The implications were explicitly economic (advertisement relationships) and implicitly ethical (public perception of journalistic integrity). I learned to maneuver these constraints through careful language choices, strategic omissions, and occasional silence. I learned, in other words, to compose myself as a professional writer under institutional pressure.</p>
<p>What’s changed in the nearly two decades since isn’t the existence of such pressures—feeling rules have always governed professional communication—but rather their visibility, velocity, and the addition of a second, equally powerful force: affective publics who can instantly circulate, appropriate, and respond to any public text. Today’s pressurized rhetorical bodies navigate not just institutional constraints but also audience demands for emotional authenticity, immediate responses, and continuous engagement. They compose themselves in public, under scrutiny, facing consequences that can include job loss, coordinated harassment, or reputational damage. Understanding how they do this—what rhetorical strategies they employ, what costs they bear, what coping mechanisms they develop—is the central project of this book.</p>
<h2 id="defining-the-pressurized-rhetorical-body">Defining the Pressurized Rhetorical Body</h2>
<p>The term “rhetorical body” might seem redundant—aren’t all bodies rhetorical? In one sense, yes: bodies always carry meaning, always communicate, always signify within social contexts. But I use “rhetorical body” specifically to denote individuals whose professional roles require public communication and who are held accountable for both the content of their messages and the affective dimensions of their expression. Professional athletes, journalists, content creators, musicians, and similar public figures are rhetorical bodies because their success depends on their ability to compose and circulate texts (broadly defined) that persuade, inform, entertain, or otherwise affect audiences. They are bodies that rhetoric flows through and from, bodies that become sites where institutional expectations and public response converge.</p>
<p>“Pressurized” adds a crucial dimension to this understanding. Pressure, in physics, describes force applied to a surface—the greater the force or the smaller the surface area, the greater the pressure. Pressurized rhetorical bodies experience force from multiple directions simultaneously: institutional feeling rules push from one side, demanding conformity to organizational cultures and communication norms; affective publics push from another, demanding authenticity, accountability, and emotional labor. The rhetorical body becomes the surface where these forces meet, and the pressure—measured in professional risk, emotional labor, and strategic constraint—can be immense.</p>
<p>This dual-pressure model distinguishes this book from scholarship that examines either workplace communication or social media discourse. Both literatures are extensive and valuable, but they typically treat their objects of study separately: organizational communication scholars analyze internal workplace dynamics, professional identities, and institutional cultures; digital rhetoric and social media scholars examine platform affordances, online publics, and viral circulation. What happens when these forces intersect—when a professional athlete must simultaneously satisfy team management and respond to fan criticism, when a journalist must balance editorial policy and public accountability, when a content creator must meet platform expectations and audience demands—has received less sustained attention. Pressurized rhetorical bodies live at this intersection, and understanding their rhetorical practices requires analytical frameworks that can account for both institutional and public pressures simultaneously.</p>
<p>The concept of pressurized rhetorical bodies also foregrounds the embodied, emotional, and often costly nature of public communication in digital environments. These are not abstract textual producers but people with careers, reputations, mental health, and physical safety at stake. The pressure they experience manifests in anxiety, strategic silence, careful word choice, defensive rhetoric, and sometimes departure from their professions or platforms altogether. Defining rhetorical bodies as “pressurized” insists that we attend to these material and affective consequences, that we understand digital communication not just as text circulation but as embodied practice performed under constraint.</p>
<h2 id="feeling-rules-and-professional-identities">Feeling Rules and Professional Identities</h2>
<p>The concept of “feeling rules” comes from sociologist Arlie Hochschild’s groundbreaking work on emotional labor, particularly her study of flight attendants. Hochschild observed that airlines didn’t just train workers to perform specific tasks—serving drinks, demonstrating safety procedures, managing logistics—they trained workers to feel specific emotions and to display those feelings in prescribed ways. Flight attendants were expected to maintain cheerfulness and warmth even when facing difficult passengers, to suppress frustration or exhaustion, to embody the airline’s brand through their affective performance. These expectations constituted “feeling rules”: socially shared norms about what emotions are appropriate to feel and express in particular situations and roles.</p>
<p>Hochschild distinguished between “surface acting” (displaying emotions one doesn’t actually feel) and “deep acting” (actually inducing the appropriate feelings in oneself). Both strategies respond to feeling rules, but deep acting—really becoming cheerful rather than just appearing cheerful—was what organizations ultimately demanded. The cost of such emotional labor, Hochschild argued, could be significant: burnout, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of alienation from one’s own feelings.</p>
<p>While Hochschild focused on service workers, feeling rules govern professional communication across industries. Lawyers are expected to project confidence and competence; teachers should demonstrate patience and enthusiasm; customer service representatives must maintain politeness regardless of provocation. For the pressurized rhetorical bodies examined in this book, feeling rules operate at the intersection of professional identity and public communication: athletes should display team loyalty and gracious sportsmanship; journalists must project objectivity and measured analysis; content creators are expected to demonstrate enthusiasm for their subjects while maintaining authenticity. These aren’t merely behavioral expectations but affective demands that shape how rhetorical bodies compose themselves for public audiences.</p>
<p>Professional sports organizations provide particularly clear examples of feeling rules in action. Soccer clubs, for instance, typically expect players to refrain from or significantly temper negative commentary about losses, referee decisions, or internal team dynamics. A player who publicly expresses frustration after a defeat, who criticizes coaching decisions, or who indicates dissatisfaction with playing time violates feeling rules even if their assessment is accurate. Such violations can result in fines, suspensions, or damaged relationships with management. The feeling rule isn’t don’t have negative feelings about losing—that would be impossible—but rather don’t express those feelings publicly, or express them only in carefully controlled ways that demonstrate team solidarity and professional composure. These sports-specific feeling rules intersect with broader cultural expectations about athletic performance and masculinity, about winning and losing, about loyalty and individualism. They’re reinforced through media training, contract clauses, and the constant surveillance of social media where any public statement becomes instantly available for scrutiny and circulation. For athletes from marginalized communities, feeling rules carry additional weight: expressions of anger or frustration may be read through racist or xenophobic frameworks, amplifying the professional risks of affective expression.</p>
<p>Journalistic feeling rules operate differently but with similar constraining force. Professional journalism has long cultivated an ideal of objectivity, a carefully managed distance from partisan politics and personal opinion (at least outside designated opinion sections). This ideal translates into feeling rules about appropriate affective display: journalists should project measured analysis rather than emotional reaction, should demonstrate respect for institutional processes even when criticizing them, should separate personal feelings from professional judgment. The Los Angeles Times and Washington Post endorsement controversies violated these feeling rules in complex ways—the owners’ decisions implicitly accused their editorial boards of partisan bias requiring correction, while the journalists’ resignations expressed anger and betrayal in carefully calibrated ways that maintained professional identity even while breaking with employers.</p>
<p>Content creators face perhaps the most complicated feeling rules because their work spans multiple, sometimes contradictory affective demands. YouTube reviewers, for instance, must project enthusiasm (because algorithmic systems reward high-engagement content and because audiences expect entertaining presentation) while also maintaining critical credibility (because viewers need to trust reviews to be useful). Sponsorship relationships add another layer: creators must demonstrate genuine appreciation for sponsored products while avoiding the perception that financial relationships compromise their judgment. The feeling rule here isn’t simply be enthusiastic or be critical but rather calibrate your affective display to signal authentic expertise within commercial constraints—a nearly impossible balance that leaves creators vulnerable to accusations of being either too negative (ungrateful, harsh, biased) or too positive (paid shill, sellout, inauthentic).</p>
<p>Feeling rules don’t operate in isolation from other aspects of professional identity; they’re deeply embedded in occupational cultures, industry norms, and power relationships. When journalists at major newspapers resign over endorsement policies, they’re not just violating feeling rules about loyalty and institutional hierarchy—they’re asserting an alternative professional identity grounded in editorial independence and public accountability. When athletes deactivate social media accounts after harassment, they’re not just avoiding affective publics—they’re navigating feeling rules about accessibility, fan engagement, and personal boundaries. When content creators disclose sponsorships transparently, they’re not just complying with FTC regulations—they’re managing feeling rules about authenticity and commercial relationships.</p>
<p>Understanding pressurized rhetorical bodies requires attending to how feeling rules shape professional identities and constrain rhetorical choices. These rules aren’t merely external impositions; they become internalized as part of professional self-understanding. A journalist learns to be objective, not just to appear objective; an athlete learns to feel team loyalty, not just to express it; a creator learns to become authentically enthusiastic, not just to perform enthusiasm. This internalization makes feeling rules particularly powerful—and violations particularly fraught—because breaking them means not just risking professional consequences but also potentially experiencing oneself as failing at professional identity.</p>
<p>Yet feeling rules are also contested, negotiated, and evolving. The resignations at the Times and Post represent challenges to journalistic feeling rules about institutional loyalty, asserting that professional identity sometimes requires public dissent. Athletes who speak openly about mental health challenge feeling rules about stoicism and invulnerability. Creators who acknowledge commercial realities negotiate feeling rules about authenticity by redefining what authentic disclosure looks like. These negotiations happen rhetorically, through public statements, social media posts, interviews, and the circulation of those texts across platforms and audiences. Pressurized rhetorical bodies don’t just passively accept feeling rules; they strategically navigate, resist, and sometimes reshape them through their communicative practices.</p>
<h2 id="affective-publics-in-the-digital-age">Affective Publics in the Digital Age</h2>
<p>If feeling rules constitute pressure from institutions and professional cultures, affective publics generate pressure from audiences. The term “affective publics,” developed by communication scholar Zizi Papacharissi, describes publics that form around and through the expression and circulation of emotion on social media platforms. Unlike traditional models of the public sphere—where rational-critical debate among citizens supposedly produces democratic consensus—affective publics are mobilized by feeling, by shared emotional investments in issues, events, or figures. They’re not necessarily rational or deliberative; they’re networked structures of sentiment that can coalesce rapidly around objects of collective attention.</p>
<p>Affective publics form when individuals share emotional responses to content, when those responses circulate and accumulate, and when the aggregated affect creates a sense of collective intensity or investment. A celebrity’s tweet, a politician’s gaffe, a journalist’s article, a creator’s review—any public text can become the catalyst for affective public formation. The public that forms isn’t a stable, pre-existing entity with clear membership or unified purpose; it’s an emergent, temporary assemblage held together by circulating affect. People join affective publics by adding their emotional responses to the stream, by liking, sharing, commenting, quote-tweeting, creating reaction videos, or otherwise contributing to the affective atmosphere. This means affective publics are fundamentally different from the audiences that pressurized rhetorical bodies might have encountered in pre-digital contexts. A newspaper columnist in 1990 certainly had readers, some of whom might write letters to the editor expressing agreement or outrage, but those readers couldn’t instantly coordinate responses, couldn’t see each other’s reactions in real-time, couldn’t transform individual feelings into collective pressure through networked amplification. Today’s affective publics can do all of this, and the scale and speed of their formation makes them uniquely powerful forces that rhetorical bodies must navigate.</p>
<p>Papacharissi emphasizes that affective publics aren’t inherently progressive or regressive, constructive or destructive. They can mobilize around social justice causes, creating collective energy for change; they can also coordinate harassment campaigns, amplifying abuse through shared outrage or disgust. They can hold powerful institutions accountable through collective attention; they can also destroy individual reputations through viral pile-ons. The affect that binds these publics together—anger, joy, disgust, excitement, solidarity, schadenfreude—doesn’t determine the political or ethical character of their actions. What matters for pressurized rhetorical bodies is that affective publics generate demands: demands for responses, for explanations, for apologies, for consistency, for emotional labor.</p>
<p>These demands take many forms. When a gaming journalist gives a major title a score that fans consider too low, affective publics demand justification: Why that score? What biases influenced the review? Does the reviewer even understand the game? The demands aren’t just for rational explanation but for emotional accountability—the reviewer should care properly, should feel appropriately about the game’s significance. When a tech reviewer criticizes a startup’s product, affective publics demand consideration of consequences: Should reviewers wield such power? Don’t they bear responsibility for job losses? The demands blend ethical argument with affective judgment about the reviewer’s character and obligations.</p>
<p>When journalists resign from newspapers over blocked endorsements, affective publics form on multiple sides: some demand absolute journalistic independence and applaud the resignations; others demand loyalty to employers and condemn the public drama; still others demand recognition that editorial endorsements themselves undermine journalistic objectivity. Each affective public makes claims not just about what should happen but about how various parties should feel—gratitude, outrage, shame, pride, obligation. Pressurized rhetorical bodies find themselves accountable to these emotional demands even when they’re contradictory or impossible to satisfy simultaneously.</p>
<p>The affordances of social media platforms shape how affective publics form and operate. Twitter/X’s retweet function allows emotional responses to cascade beyond original followers, building momentum as more users add their voices. YouTube’s comment sections create spaces where affective publics can aggregate responses, generate consensus, and perform collective identity through shared emotional registers. Reddit’s upvoting system allows affective publics to foreground certain interpretations or responses while burying others, creating apparent consensus that may or may not reflect broader opinion. TikTok’s duet and stitch features enable affective publics to directly respond to and remix content, creating chains of emotional reaction that bind participants together through shared reference points.</p>
<p>Platform algorithms further amplify affective public formation by prioritizing engagement, which often means prioritizing emotional content. Anger, outrage, and moral indignation generate high engagement; measured analysis typically doesn’t. This creates a structural bias toward what scholars Sarah Sobieraj and Jeffrey Berry call “outrage discourse”—communication designed to provoke strong emotional reactions rather than careful deliberation. Pressurized rhetorical bodies operate within these algorithmic environments, knowing that their content will be evaluated not just by human audiences but by systems that reward affective intensity. This creates additional pressure to compose in ways that generate engagement, even when doing so might violate feeling rules about professional temperance or objectivity.</p>
<p>Importantly, affective publics aren’t monolithic. Multiple affective publics can form around the same text or event, each with different emotional investments and demands. When Marques Brownlee reviewed the Fisker Ocean and Humane AI Pin, some affective publics formed around concern for startup viability and innovation, demanding more sympathetic treatment; others formed around consumer protection and honest reviewing, demanding unflinching criticism; still others formed around racial politics, demanding recognition of double standards in how Black reviewers are treated compared to white reviewers. Brownlee faced pressure from all these publics simultaneously, each making claims about what he owed them and how he should feel about his reviewing practices.</p>
<p>This multiplicity means pressurized rhetorical bodies can rarely satisfy all affective publics simultaneously. Any rhetorical choice—any tweet, article, video, or statement—will likely disappoint or anger some segment of the available audiences. The strategic question becomes not “how do I please everyone?” (impossible) but rather “which affective publics do I prioritize, and what consequences am I willing to accept?” This strategic navigation happens under time pressure (social media demands rapid response), under visibility (every choice is public and preserved), and under affective intensity (audiences aren’t just disagreeing; they’re feeling strongly about disagreements).</p>
<p>Affective publics also create what we might call “emotional debt” for pressurized rhetorical bodies. The expectation of continuous engagement, of authentic emotional availability, of responsive interaction generates an ongoing obligation to perform affective labor for audiences. Content creators feel pressure to respond to comments, to acknowledge fan support, to address criticism, to maintain consistent online presence—all of which requires emotional energy and strategic self-presentation. Athletes are expected to engage with fans on social media, to share behind-the-scenes content, to demonstrate appreciation for support—extending their professional obligations beyond game performance into constant affective availability. Journalists increasingly face expectations to be accessible on social media, to engage with reader responses, to explain their reporting in informal contexts—blurring boundaries between professional and personal, between work time and personal time.</p>
<p>This emotional debt compounds the pressure created by feeling rules because affective publics demand different—often opposite—emotional displays than professional institutions expect. Where an athlete’s team might enforce feeling rules about restraint and team solidarity, affective publics might demand individual expression and authentic frustration. Where a news organization’s feeling rules emphasize measured objectivity, affective publics might demand passionate advocacy or clear moral positioning. Where a platform’s feeling rules encourage consistent positivity and engagement, some affective publics might demand critical distance and selective silence. Pressurized rhetorical bodies must navigate these contradictory demands without the luxury of separating institutional and public contexts—their social media presence is simultaneously workplace communication and public discourse, professional identity performance and personal expression.</p>
<h2 id="the-rhetorical-body-as-a-site-of-tension">The Rhetorical Body as a Site of Tension</h2>
<p>The pressurized rhetorical body emerges at the intersection of feeling rules and affective publics, caught between institutional demands and audience expectations that often pull in opposite directions. This isn’t merely a matter of competing interests—employer versus public, professional obligations versus personal authenticity—but rather a fundamental tension between different models of appropriate emotional expression and rhetorical performance. The rhetorical body becomes the site where these tensions manifest, where incompatible demands must somehow be negotiated, where strategic choices carry professional and personal consequences.</p>
<p>Consider what happened when Tottenham Hotspur forward Brennan Johnson deactivated his Instagram account in September 2024. Johnson had been experiencing poor form, and affective publics on social media had coalesced around criticism of his performances—criticism that increasingly included racist abuse and personal attacks. From the perspective of affective publics, their demands seemed reasonable: as a highly-paid professional athlete whose performances directly affected the team’s success, Johnson was accountable to fans who invested emotionally and financially in the club. They expected response, acknowledgment, perhaps evidence of determination to improve. Their affect—frustration, disappointment, anger—circulated and intensified through social media platforms, creating an atmosphere Johnson couldn’t escape. But Johnson also operated under his club’s feeling rules about social media engagement. Professional sports organizations typically encourage athletes to maintain social media presence as part of brand building and fan engagement; silence or withdrawal can be read as unprofessional, as failing to honor obligations to supporters. Yet those same organizations also impose feeling rules about how athletes should respond to criticism: with grace, with determination, with team-first rhetoric rather than defensiveness or counter-aggression. Johnson’s deactivation violated these institutional expectations—it was silence, yes, but not the kind of graceful, team-oriented silence that feeling rules would endorse. It was protective silence, self-preservation, an implicit acknowledgment that engagement had become untenable.</p>
<p>The tension Johnson navigated wasn’t just between responding or not responding; it was between contradictory models of professional identity. Affective publics demanded emotional accountability and authentic engagement, even when that engagement had become a vector for abuse. Institutional feeling rules demanded professional composure and brand-appropriate presence, even when that presence exposed him to harassment. His rhetorical body—literally his body, subject to racist abuse; figuratively his professional identity as a footballer and public figure—became the site where these incompatible demands converged. Neither silence nor engagement could satisfy both pressures simultaneously.</p>
<p>This kind of tension appears across the cases examined in this book, though it takes different forms depending on professional context. Journalists at the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post faced institutional feeling rules demanding loyalty and discretion about internal editorial processes, even when those processes involved what they considered ethical violations. Affective publics (or multiple, competing affective publics) demanded transparency, demanded public accountability, demanded that journalists explain why their newspapers weren’t endorsing candidates in a consequential election. Some affective publics wanted journalists to resign in protest; others wanted them to stay and fight internally; still others wanted them to remain neutral about their employers’ decisions. The journalists who resigned satisfied some affective publics while violating institutional feeling rules; those who stayed satisfied institutional expectations while facing criticism from certain affective publics. Either choice involved navigating tension, accepting consequences, strategically positioning their rhetorical bodies within impossible circumstances.</p>
<p>Content creators like Marques Brownlee face tensions between platform feeling rules (maintain consistent output, maximize engagement, project enthusiasm), sponsor feeling rules (demonstrate product value, avoid overly harsh criticism, maintain relationships), professional feeling rules (protect journalistic credibility, serve audience interests, maintain reviewing standards), and affective public demands (provide honest assessment, acknowledge power dynamics, consider economic consequences of negative reviews). When Brownlee reviewed the Humane AI Pin negatively, he satisfied some affective publics (consumers wanting honest product assessment) while facing criticism from others (people concerned about startup viability, people invested in AI innovation, people who saw his review as wielding excessive power). He maintained his professional feeling rules about honest reviewing while potentially straining sponsor relationships and platform optimization. His rhetorical body—his professional identity as a trusted tech reviewer—became the site where all these pressures met, where any choice involved trade-offs and consequences.</p>
<p>The rhetorical body as a site of tension isn’t a temporary or resolvable condition; it’s the permanent state of public-facing communication in digital environments. The tensions don’t resolve; they’re managed, navigated, endured. Pressurized rhetorical bodies develop strategies for coping with these tensions—strategic silence, careful calibration of affective display, community building for mutual support, platform migration, explicit boundary-setting, rhetorical reframing of criticism—but these strategies don’t eliminate pressure. They redistribute it, make it more bearable, create space for professional survival and personal wellbeing. Understanding these strategies, how they work and what they cost, is central to this book’s project. The metaphor of the rhetorical body as a site of tension also emphasizes embodiment and materiality. These aren’t abstract rhetorical situations but lived experiences with physical and psychological consequences. Journalists who resign face career uncertainty and financial precarity. Athletes who deactivate social media accounts sacrifice professional opportunities and income streams. Content creators who receive harassment campaigns experience anxiety, depression, and sometimes physical symptoms of chronic stress. The tensions that characterize pressurized rhetorical bodies aren’t merely intellectual puzzles or strategic challenges; they manifest in bodies, in mental health, in the material conditions of professional communication labor.</p>
<p>Sara Ahmed’s work on affective economies and the politics of emotion helps illuminate why the rhetorical body becomes such a fraught site. Ahmed argues that emotions aren’t internal, private experiences that we then express outwardly; rather, emotions are produced through encounters with objects, texts, and people. They circulate between bodies, sticking to some objects and sliding off others, accumulating intensity through repetition and social reinforcement. When I say affective publics circulate emotion, I mean that anger, disgust, joy, or solidarity moves between participants, attaches to specific rhetorical bodies or texts, and gains force through aggregation.</p>
<p>This circulation means pressurized rhetorical bodies can’t control the emotions that attach to them or their work. A journalist’s resignation meant to express principled objection becomes attached to narratives about media bias, partisan warfare, or professional narcissism depending on which affective publics take it up. An athlete’s silence meant to preserve mental health becomes read as unprofessional withdrawal or appropriate boundary-setting depending on who’s interpreting. A creator’s critical review meant to serve consumer interests becomes attached to accusations of wielding power irresponsibly or performing necessary accountability depending on the affective publics circulating it. The rhetorical body can’t unilaterally determine how its communications will be felt or what emotions will attach to its professional identity.</p>
<p>Yet rhetorical bodies aren’t entirely powerless; they can strategically compose themselves in ways that attempt to manage emotional circulation, that anticipate how affective publics might respond, that satisfy feeling rules while maintaining professional integrity. This strategic composition—the rhetorical work of navigating pressure—is what this book examines in detail. But understanding that work requires acknowledging the fundamental asymmetry between pressurized rhetorical bodies and the forces that pressure them. A single journalist faces an institutional employer with vast resources and a multiplicity of affective publics with endless capacity for emotional intensity. A single athlete faces a professional club with contractual power and affective publics that can coordinate harassment across platforms. A single creator faces platform algorithms that shape content visibility and affective publics that can mobilize economic boycotts or harassment campaigns.</p>
<p>The rhetorical body as a site of tension is therefore also a site of vulnerability, of exposure to forces that exceed individual control. This vulnerability doesn’t mean passivity—the case studies in this book demonstrate substantial rhetorical agency, creative strategy, resistant communication—but it does mean that agency operates under profound constraint. Recognizing this constraint, taking it seriously as a condition of contemporary digital communication, is essential for understanding both how pressurized rhetorical bodies compose themselves and what ethical obligations institutions, platforms, and audiences might bear.</p>
<p>The tension that characterizes pressurized rhetorical bodies also operates across time in ways that compound pressure. A tweet sent years ago can resurface in new contexts, attached to different affective publics, generating fresh controversy. An athlete’s past statements about loyalty can be weaponized when they seek transfers. A journalist’s previous positions can be deployed to question their current credibility. A creator’s old sponsored content can undermine present claims to independence. The rhetorical body isn’t just pressurized in the moment of composition; it remains pressurized across time as past communications circulate in new contexts, accumulating new meanings and attachments.</p>
<p>This temporal dimension means pressurized rhetorical bodies must compose with awareness of future circulation, must anticipate how their communications might be taken up in contexts they can’t predict or control. This anticipatory pressure adds another layer of constraint: not just what can I say given current feeling rules and affective publics? but what might this mean in five years when contexts have shifted? Such anticipatory constraint encourages strategic ambiguity, careful hedging, defensive rhetoric—all of which can undermine the authentic engagement that affective publics demand while still potentially violating future feeling rules that don’t yet exist. The rhetorical body as a site of tension is thus temporally extended, existing not just in present moments of composition but across the archived, searchable, endlessly recirculating history of digital communication. Every public text becomes part of a permanent record that can be retrieved, recontextualized, and weaponized. This permanence intensifies pressure because mistakes, misjudgments, or context-dependent statements can never be fully left behind. The rhetorical body carries its history with it, and that history becomes ammunition for both institutional discipline and affective public judgment.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-analyzing-rhetorical-bodies-under-pressure">Methodology: Analyzing Rhetorical Bodies Under Pressure</h2>
<p>Understanding pressurized rhetorical bodies requires methodological approaches that can attend to multiple levels of analysis simultaneously: individual rhetorical choices, institutional contexts and feeling rules, platform affordances and algorithmic systems, and affective public formation and circulation. This book employs a rhetorical-affective methodology—an approach that treats texts as embedded in emotional ecologies, as strategic responses to pressure, and as performances of professional identity under constraint. Unlike the interview-based methods of my previous book, the primary method is close rhetorical analysis of public communications: social media posts, resignation announcements, video statements, recorded interviews, and other texts through which pressurized rhetorical bodies compose themselves. But this analysis doesn’t treat texts as isolated artifacts; it situates them within the specific institutional and affective contexts that shaped their production. When analyzing Benn Jordan’s response to criticism, for instance, I attended not just to his word choices and rhetorical strategies but to the larger context and YouTube policy that preceded his resignation, the institutional feeling rules faced by creawtors, and the multiple affective publics that formed around his departure. The text becomes intelligible as a pressurized communication only when we understand the forces that constrained its production.</p>
<p>This contextualization requires research into professional norms and organizational cultures. For the journalism chapters I examine editorial policies, ownership structures, and industry discourse about journalistic independence and institutional loyalty. For the athletics chapter, I investigated sports organizations’ social media guidelines, media training practices, and public statements about player conduct. For the content creator chapter, I analyze platform policies, sponsorship disclosure requirements, and community norms about authenticity and commercial relationships. These institutional contexts provide the framework for understanding feeling rules—what emotions can and cannot be expressed, what affective displays are professionally appropriate, what consequences follow violations.</p>
<p>Understanding affective publics requires examining not just initial posts or statements but the cascading responses they generate: retweets, quote tweets, comment threads, reaction videos, and news coverage. In each chapter, I employ quantitative methods to understand the scale and character of affective public response. Sentiment analysis of YouTube comment sections, for instance, revealed the predominant emotional registers in responses to creator content. Tracking engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) on a post illuminated which aspects of pressurized communications generated the most affective intensity. A sentiment analysis complements close reading by providing evidence of patterns that might not be apparent from examining individual texts.</p>
<p>Relatedly, the methodology also attends to temporality—how pressurized communications unfold over time, how initial statements generate responses that demand follow-up communications, how rhetorical bodies strategically time their interventions. Many of the cases examined in this book involve extended exchanges rather than single moments. Athletes might maintain silence for weeks before speaking, and creators might address controversies through multiple videos as affective publics shift. Analyzing these temporal dimensions requires reconstructing communication sequences, understanding strategic timing, and recognizing how pressure accumulates or dissipates across days, weeks, or months.</p>
<p>Importantly, this methodology foregrounds the rhetorical agency of pressurized bodies while acknowledging the constraints they navigate. My analytical stance inquiries how these professionals strategically compose themselves under genuinely difficult circumstances that constrain but don’t determine their rhetorical choices. This stance requires analytical humility—recognizing that as an observer not subject to the same pressures, I can identify strategies and costs that the rhetorical bodies themselves might articulate differently. My own positionality matters for this analysis. As someone who has been a pressurized rhetorical body—as a journalist navigating editorial feeling rules, as an academic navigating institutional expectations, as a former digital media editor making public-facing decisions—I bring felt experience to this work. I’ve navigated the anxiety of public criticism and made strategic communication choices under pressure. This experience informs my analysis, helping me recognize the lived dimensions of pressurized communication that might not be apparent from texts alone.</p>
<p>But positionality also means limitations. As a white man working in relatively privileged professional contexts, I haven’t experienced the racist harassment that BIPOC athletes and creators face. I haven’t navigated the gendered abuse that women journalists and content producers endure. My analysis must therefore remain attentive to how intersecting identities shape both the pressure rhetorical bodies experience and the strategies available to them. When examining Son Heung-Min’s navigation of racist abuse or Alyssa Mercante’s experience of coordinated harassment, I rely not just on textual analysis but on scholarship about racism in sports culture and misogyny in gaming communities to contextualize pressures I haven’t personally faced. In fact, many of the cases examined involve individuals who experienced significant harm—harassment, job loss, mental health struggles. Analyzing their pressurized communications requires balancing scholarly analysis with ethical responsibility not to reproduce harm or exploit suffering for academic purposes. I’ve attempted to center the agency and rhetorical skill of pressurized bodies rather than sensationalizing their victimization, to critique the systems that create pressure rather than judging individual strategic choices.</p>
<p>I recognize the human costs of pressure while still taking seriously the rhetorical work such pressure demands. I’ve been selective about which details to include, particularly regarding harassment. While documenting the intensity and patterns of abuse is necessary for understanding the pressures rhetorical bodies face, reproducing the most vicious or degrading comments would serve no analytical purpose beyond demonstrating cruelty. The methodology therefore involves providing enough evidence to substantiate claims about affective public toxicity without amplifying that toxicity or re-traumatizing those who experienced it. The case study approach allows deep engagement with specific instances of pressurized communication while also enabling comparative analysis across professional contexts. Each chapter focuses on a particular professional domain—athletics, journalism, content creation—examining how feeling rules and affective publics operate distinctly in each. But the cases are selected to reveal patterns that transcend individual contexts, strategies that appear across domains, tensions that characterize pressurized communication generally. The goal isn’t comprehensive coverage of all pressurized rhetorical bodies or all professional contexts but rather rich, detailed analysis that illuminates broader phenomena through carefully chosen examples.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-descriptions">Chapter Descriptions</h2>
<p>This book is organized around three professional domains, each examined through detailed case studies that illuminate how feeling rules and affective publics create distinctive pressures. The last two chapter synthesize these insights across cases to offer analytical frameworks and practical strategies for recognizing and navigating pressurized communication. While each chapter can be read independently, they’re sequenced to build progressively more complex understandings of rhetorical pressure, moving from contexts where feeling rules are most explicit (professional sports) to contexts where multiple, competing institutional and audience expectations create extraordinarily complex pressure (contemporary journalism).</p>
<p><em>Chapter One: Pressurized Athletes</em> examines how professional athletes navigate social media communication under intense institutional and public scrutiny. The chapter focuses on a racist incident between players at Tottenham Hotsput, analyzing silence and institutional shielding as rhetorical strategies that simultaneously violates institutional feeling rules about fan engagement and protects against untenable affective public pressure. The chapter’s case study centres on Son Heung-Min’s more carefully managed social media approach, examining how the South Korean footballer navigates racist abuse while maintaining professional presence. Son’s rhetorical strategy involves public statements that acknowledge criticism while reframing it through team solidarity and personal determination, that satisfy institutional feeling rules while creating distance from the most toxic affective publics. By comparing Brennan Johnson’s protective silence with Son’s managed engagement, the chapter reveals a spectrum of rhetorical strategies athletes employ under pressure, each with distinct costs and consequences. Athletes are expected to demonstrate team loyalty, gracious sportsmanship, and professional composure even when facing losses, criticism, or personal attacks. These feeling rules intensify for athletes from marginalized communities, who face additional scrutiny about “appropriate” emotional display and whose expressions of frustration or anger may be read through racist frameworks that portray them as volatile, ungrateful, or unprofessional.</p>
<p>The chapter also examines the consequences of different strategic choices. Johnson’s silence protected his mental health but generated speculation about his professionalism and commitment; it satisfied his immediate need for safety while potentially violating sponsor expectations and club guidelines. Son’s strategic engagement maintains his professional brand and sponsor relationships but requires ongoing emotional labor and exposure to racist abuse. Neither strategy eliminates pressure; both redistribute it in ways that involve trade-offs between professional obligations, personal wellbeing, and public accountability.</p>
<p><em>Chapter Two: Pressurized Journalists</em> investigates how journalists at major publications respond to editorial policies that constrain their professional expression, including on the 2024 crises at the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post where ownership blocked presidential endorsements. These cases create a fresh exigence for analyzing journalism as a field where institutional feeling rules and professional ethics often conflict. The pressures on rhetorical bodies emerges as journalist balance organizational loyalty with integrity. The first case study of this chapter is that of ABC White House correspondent Mary Bruce and her questioning of President Donald Trump about dealings with Saudi Arabia. A substantial section bridges traditional journalism and creator culture by examining gaming journalist Alyssa Mercante’s experience at Kotaku. Mercante faced coordinated harassment campaigns as part of what observers called “GamerGate 2.0,” with YouTuber SmashJT creating over 90 videos targeting her work across one year. The harassment combined traditional journalistic pressures (accusations of bias, demands for “objective” coverage) with creator culture toxicity (personal attacks, appearance-based harassment, coordinated abuse campaigns). Mercante’s December 2024 lawsuit against SmashJT and subsequent resignation demonstrate how harassment creates pressure that even institutional employment cannot mitigate—the feeling rules about professional composure and continuing work become untenable when affective publics mobilize systematic abuse.</p>
<p>The chapter employs sentiment analysis of YouTube comments on videos about Bruce and Mercante to quantify harassment intensity and demonstrate patterns in affective public formation. This quantitative evidence supplements rhetorical analysis, showing how negative sentiment creates an affective atmosphere that pressurizes not just the individual journalist but the broader professional community. Other journalists observe such campaigns and adjust their own rhetorical strategies accordingly, self-censoring or avoiding controversial topics to prevent similar targeting. Digital journalism has transformed feeling rules about audience engagement. Where previous generations of journalists could maintain professional distance from readers, contemporary journalists face expectations of social media accessibility, responsive engagement, and emotional availability. These expectations create new forms of pressure as journalists navigate professional feeling rules about objectivity and measured analysis while affective publics demand authentic passion, clear moral positioning, and continuous interaction. The resulting tension often manifests in rhetorical strategies that assert journalistic authority and independence while deflecting or dismissing affective public criticism.</p>
<p><em>Chapter Three: Pressurized Creators</em> analyzes how digital content creators navigate the paradox of “managed authenticity”—needing to appear genuine while operating under significant commercial pressures from platforms, sponsors, and algorithmic systems. The chapter centers on two detailed case studies: tech reviewer Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) and musician/producer Benn Jordan, both of whom faced public controversy over how they manage commercial relationships and disclosure practices. Brownlee’s 2024 reviews of the Fisker Ocean electric vehicle and Humane AI Pin wearable device generated intense backlash, with critics arguing his negative assessments contributed to company failures and job losses. The controversy reveals multiple, competing affective publics: some demanded harsh honesty to protect consumers from bad products; others demanded empathy for struggling startups and their employees; still others highlighted racial dynamics, noting that Brownlee faced harsher criticism than white reviewers who also gave negative reviews. The chapter examines how Brownlee’s rhetorical response navigated these competing pressures, asserting reviewing independence while acknowledging reviewer influence, maintaining professional credibility while addressing racial bias concerns.</p>
<p>Benn Jordan’s experience with sponsorship transparency illustrates different dimensions of creator pressure. When Jordan disclosed that a music gear company had sent him products for review, some affective publics accused him of compromising his independence, even though FTC regulations require such disclosure and Jordan maintained editorial control. The controversy illuminates a double bind: failing to disclose sponsorships violates regulatory and ethical requirements (and triggers “paid shill” accusations), but disclosing them triggers accusations of compromised independence. Creators must navigate feeling rules from platforms (maintain consistent output and engagement), sponsors (demonstrate product value), professional communities (uphold reviewing standards), and audiences (project authentic enthusiasm), all while platforms’ algorithmic systems reward emotional intensity over measured analysis.</p>
<p>The chapter examines specific rhetorical strategies creators employ to maintain perceived authenticity: explicit disclosure practices that exceed regulatory requirements, meta-commentary about commercial relationships and their constraints, community engagement that demonstrates responsiveness to audience concerns, and strategic calibration of critical versus positive content. It also explores the economic pressures that shape these strategies—creators’ dependence on platform ad revenue, sponsorship income, and audience financial support creates vulnerability to affective public backlash that can directly threaten livelihoods.</p>
<p>A significant section addresses the harassment that creators face when affective publics mobilize against them. While not reaching the coordinated intensity seen in some gaming communities (examined more fully in Chapter Two’s discussion of gaming journalist Alyssa Mercante), both Brownlee and Benn Jordan experienced sustained criticism that blurred lines between legitimate disagreement and personal attack. The chapter analyzes how this harassment compounds commercial pressure, making creators increasingly risk-averse and defensive in their public communications.</p>
<p><em>Chapter Four: Pressuring Institutions and Audiences</em> shifts from analytical case studies to offering frameworks and strategies for recognizing and responding to rhetorical pressure. The chapter is structured around four key areas: recognizing pressurized moments, developing analytical tools, examining institutional responsibilities, and exploring audience literary. The section on recognizing pressurized moments provides readers—whether content creators, institutional communicators, or concerned audiences—with frameworks for identifying when rhetorical bodies experience dual pressure from feeling rules and affective publics. It examines warning signs: escalating criticism that crosses from content disagreement to personal attack, institutional responses that constrain rather than support pressurized bodies, affective public formation around moral indignation or collective outrage, and defensive rhetoric that signals composers navigating impossible constraints. This recognition is essential because pressure often intensifies gradually, with individual incidents seeming manageable until accumulated stress becomes unsustainable.</p>
<p>The analytical tools section offers practical frameworks for examining pressurized communication. Drawing on the case studies, it provides questions for analyzing feeling rules (What institutional expectations govern emotional expression? What consequences follow violations? How are these rules enforced and by whom?), for understanding affective publics (What emotions bind this public together? What demands are being made? Which platforms amplify which affects?), and for recognizing rhetorical strategies (What constraints is this communication navigating? What trade-offs does this strategy involve? What costs does the rhetorical body bear?). These tools serve both critical analysis and strategic composition, helping readers understand others’ pressurized communications and navigate their own.</p>
<p>Institutional strategies for ethical guidelines receives substantial attention because organizations—whether sports teams, news outlets, or platform companies—bear responsibility for the feeling rules they impose and their consequences. The chapter examines how institutions can develop more ethical approaches to employee communication: creating clear, reasonable social media policies that balance organizational interests with individual wellbeing; providing genuine support when employees face harassment rather than defensively protecting institutional reputation; acknowledging trade-offs between different institutional values (brand control versus employee autonomy, for instance) rather than pretending conflicts don’t exist; and regularly reviewing feeling rules to ensure they remain appropriate for contemporary digital environments.</p>
<p>The audience literacy section addresses how individuals who participate in affective publics can recognize their own role in creating pressure. It explores the difference between legitimate criticism and harassment, how affective intensity can obscure ethical boundaries, why demands for emotional labor from public figures may be unreasonable even when they feel justified, and how circulation practices (sharing, amplifying, engaging) contribute to pressure ecosystems. This section is perhaps the most challenging because it requires readers to examine their own participation in digital discourse, to recognize how individual actions aggregate into collective pressure, and to consider ethical responsibilities they may prefer to avoid.</p>
<p><em>Chapter Five: Pressure Praxis and Annotated Teaching Assignments</em> focuses more deeply on working with students. The teaching applications lead to pedagogical project I call the “Pressure Performance Project,” designed for writing and communication courses. Students write from multiple personas experiencing escalating pressure: an emerging content creator facing sponsor tensions, a professional in crisis management addressing public controversy, a journalist navigating editorial constraints, and a gaming journalist experiencing coordinated harassment. Each scenario requires students to compose under specific feeling rules and affective public pressures, experiencing viscerally how such constraints shape rhetorical choices. The escalating structure allows students to choose their engagement level—completing earlier, less intense scenarios or pushing into the harassment scenario that simulates systematic abuse.</p>
<p>This pedagogical approach emerged from recognizing that understanding pressurized rhetoric requires more than analytical study; it requires embodied awareness of how pressure feels and constrains. By writing as pressurized rhetorical bodies rather than just analyzing them, students develop empathy for those navigating such circumstances, recognize the ethical complexity of situations that might seem straightforward from outside, and consider how they might compose themselves if facing similar pressures. The project also creates space for reflection on students’ own social media practices, their participation in affective publics, and their potential futures as content creators or professional communicators.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>Conclusion: Composing Under Future Pressure</em> offers future research directions. Artificial intelligence and algorithmic content generation might transform pressurized communication, Different cultural contexts shape feeling rules and affective public formation. Generational differences affect expectations about authenticity and professional boundaries, and new platform architectures might reduce rather than intensify rhetorical pressure. These future directions position the book as contributing to ongoing conversations about digital communication ethics rather than offering definitive conclusions.</p>
