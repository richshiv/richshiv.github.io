<h3 id="why-game-developers-livestream-their-productions-and-why-they-don’t">Why Game Developers Livestream Their Productions (and Why They Don’t)</h3>
<p>Outside of writing studies, creators in professions such as games and comics have been livestreaming their projects for years. In fact, when I was drafting this chapter in May 2021, creators across both were coming together for a live-streamed event called Comics X Games, which is part of the Toronto Comic Arts Festival and organized by the Hand Eye Society, a Toronto-based nonprofit organization that promotes experimental games and marginalized creators. Comics X Games unfolded over seven days, featuring livestreaming talks, game playthroughs, and panels over several hours each day. Overlapping with that event was the Toronto Game Jam, an online event in which game creators created a game with a 72-hour deadline. For TO Jam 2020, Attila Gabriel Branyiczky streamed his game development process under the name Bluish Green Productions. Here he is speaking about the value of livestreaming during jams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gabriel Branyiczky: If I can’t get this game out in front of playtesters, because it’s a jam game and I have 48 hours to do so, then the two or three people writing back responses and giving a feedback in the chat saying, “Oh, that doesn’t really make sense to me, how’s that gonna work?” is super helpful, because then I can say, “Oh, all right, let’s put in an extra bit of feedback here and extra bit of feedback there.” Again, just all trying to smooth out the process of communicating the way that I know the game functions in a way that a player can understand as well.  #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section of Chapter Three presents stories of creators and their commentaries from interviews I conducted in 2020 and 2021. All creators I reference here stream or have streamed regularly&mdash;say, a few hours each week&mdash;on platforms like Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>Before we go further, though, we should probably start with a basic question about livestreaming that came out of several interviews.</p>
<p><i>Why Do Creators Livestream?</i></p>
<p>Staying on task and/or building communities of support—which we can argue invite feedback and support revisions—came up numerous times in my interviews with creators when I asked about livestreaming on Twitch. Talking over Skype from his home in Seattle, Danny Weinbaum said livestreaming on Twitch gave him momentum as he was working on tasks for his open-world, narrative game, <cite>Eastshade,</cite> about a painter who returns home after an accident at sea. Listen as Weinbaum speaks about “cranking” in relation to audiences “watching.” His experience started at home and moved to Twitch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Danny Weinbaum:….but actually the reason why I started Twitch streaming this is because I noticed once someone’s watching me I basically crank non-stop. It started because my partner, Jacqueline, sometimes we would be working on something together and we would get so much done because I was in the driver’s seat and then we were discussing and I would want to go as fast as possible because you know, we’re moving, getting stuff done. I’m not gonna browse Twitter or whatever. And I thought, “well gosh, if I could just have people watching me all the time. I wonder if I would just like crank, if I’d be unstoppable,” and so I started Twitch streaming and it worked extrciteely well because the faster I went the more interesting it was. For some really gnarly programming problcites the eyeball actually makes it harder to solve the problcites, but for certain tasks, streaming works really well. And that’s basically why I kept streaming. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weinbaum’s comments raise a good point about Twitch. In a way, it’s a performance space, with implicit expectations that you do something while on stream—chat, code, edit—let alone keep it interesting for audiences. Twitch affords self-surveillance and voluntary public surveillance for getting tasks done, for staying motivated to complete a project. Creators monitor what they do on screen while being aware of the real-time audience reactions to what they do. It’s easy to get caught up in the metrics of the latter. The software Streamlabs OBS, for example, helps creators track the number of viewers and new followers on a live stream and replicates the live chat column available on Twitch and YouTube. (If you’re listening or reading to this chapter on my book’s website, then you can see an citebedded video of me discussing Streamlabs for my related series “100 Days of Writing” that I’ve begun streaming on Twitch and YouTube. That’s in the section titled “Ephciteera: Chapter Two.”)</p>
<p>Enter the challenge, perhaps the paradox, of livestreaming. If a creator is paying attention to those aesthetics and metrics about audiences in their livestream, then they might do less composing than they do off screen. To shed light on this idea, I want to play a clip from an interview with Ian Endsley and Carter Lodwick, two game developers beyond the award-winning game Wide Ocean, Big Jacket, a short, narrative-driven game about music, camping, and relationships. Ian and Carter used to stream on Twitch but recently scaled back that practice to focus on a recent project. Here’s Ian, followed by Carter, talking about how Twitch affected their processes. They work together in an apartment in Los Angeles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich Shivener  30:23: How do you feel about live streaming your own work in development? I saw that you have you have a Twitch, link and so forth. Yeah. What’s your take on that approach for game development?<br>
<br><br>
Ian Endsley 30:36 : I love watching people do that and I actually really liked doing it. I think it keeps me focused and it’s fun to talk out what I’m trying to do while I’m doing it. But I’m also just not super-comfortable in front of the camera in that way,  so I really have to do a lot of prep work and planning to feel like I have a task to do.  I’d like to get in a place where I stream more. I really enjoyed when we did that a couple years ago, and I think it’s awesome that people do it. I love watching people do that. But then like, I don’t know when it’s the morning and I actually have to do it, I clam up a little bit.<br>
<br><br>
31:46 Rich Shivener: Carter, what do you think about that?<br>
<br><br>
31:51 Carter Lodwick: I haven’t done too much streaming of my work process. I’ve done it a couple times, and I do enjoy it, but it generally to me feels more like a public service rather than as a way to help my own process, you know? When I do it, I’m 80% focusing on describing what I’m doing and  trying to make it clear to people who are watching and 20% actually being able to, like, focus on  the best way that I want to solve this problcite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Endsley and Lodwick’s comments are interesting because digital rhetoric and writing process theorists have argued ad nauseam that the writer never writes alone, that external forces, tools, notifications, audiences, are fundamental, often unseen elciteents of composing. Livestreaming puts the external and internal on full display, mostly likely in public. Weinbaum and many other creators not mentioned here suggest that preparing and displaying their work as a live performance is worth the effort, especially if live-streaming helps push their work forward. Aesthetics and metrics, that is, are not distractions but vital, affective forces that support their work. This is not to say that Weinbaum and others only do work when they’re streaming on Twitch—Twitch is rhetorically and affectively additive to their composing practices.</p>
<p>However, for many streamers, livestreaming is not about focusing on tasks but rather building conversations and communities that can support revisions for a work in progress.</p>
<p><i>Building Communities</i></p>
<p>Regarding communities, I’m speaking with Sarah Alfageeh, one of the founders of the gaming platform One More Multiverse (OMM). OMM is a platform that helps users transform their table-top roleplaying campaigns into visual worlds ripe with characters and scenes that often require verbal explanation and imagination from those who play. (If you have ever played a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, you know that requirciteent can be difficult when playing a tabletop RPG with a large group.). As Alfageeh tells me, the idea for OMM started in a Boston living room and some pixel art that aimed to create more inclusive characters than they were seeing in the table RPG landscape. The group was seeing its collective itself, its racial-cultural diversity, in that universe. Here is Alfageeh talking about their initial ideas for OMM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of it came from the fact that me, and a lot of my friends come from these marginalized backgrounds, half our friend group is Muslim as well. We weren’t seeing any fantasy out there, any sci fi out there that spoke to our lived experience. So it was a lot of, you know, if you want it done right, do it yourself. We thought we could find that home in in TTRPGs. After our first couple failed sessions, my friend who’s a very extra person, bless him, he was like, “Okay, I have an idea. Everybody, come back to our house. I think I want to give this one more shot.” And he sent us all a link on our phones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a low-stakes version of a game, each of their names and pixelated representations being displayed on the screen. She tells me, “We’re seeing our characters move across the screen, and we’re receiving inventory itcites in this amazing, like half video game half improvised storytelling way. That day we played for seven hours. We’re like, oh, shit, there’s something here.”</p>
<p>Not long after that idea took off, a group of friends became a 20-person team that is international and working fully rciteotely—and 17-million dollars in start-up funds—to build One More Multiverse.</p>
<p>One fascinating thing about OMM is the team works hard to involve its audiences and potential users in the platform’s development through live feedback and gameplay on Twitch. It doesn’t have to worry so much about funding the development, per se, but rather its successful launch. The team streams (how often) on Twitch, rotating between campaigns inside OMM and live development of new features available to beta users. On a recent (day of the week), SA’s colleague MM is streaming her practices as art director for the platform.</p>
<p>She begins with an underwater map, asking for suggestions along the way. With numerous viewers, the chat is active with ideas. What about sunlight? How about broken columns? Does that skeleton in the corner do anything? The map begins to look like the rcitenants of a sunken city, a kind of Atlantis.</p>
<p>[Brief video and soundbites from the stream.]</p>
<p>When Alfageeh and I are speaking on Zoom, I ask her why she and MM do this kind of inventional work on Twitch, during which moments of real-time feedback citeerge, with public audiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alfageeh  40:47: I mean, it is my job in the sense that as creative director on the team, it’s hard to explain what exactly I do, because I do a little bit of everything on the team. But if I can summarize it in a sentence, my job is to have a deep, well earned intuition for what makes people want to play our games. Being a player, interacting with people through the different - we consider Twitch, also a distribution channel in Game Dev. This is where people are going to organically discover the game too. I need to know what that experience looks like top to bottom as a viewer, as the person streaming it, as a person playing in it as a guest the whole thing. So for me, having that experience, top to bottom is work. And of course, it is play because my job is to play. It’s the same way that I view like running games on on our discord, it is this fun, collaborative, very social experience. I’m a huge extrovert, this is where I get my energy from. And at the same time, I’m logging bugs, I’m getting feedback, I’m doing all this stuff. It’s all part of it, there’s no way to kind of sidestep that experience, I wouldn’t expect it of one of our engineers, but as someone who’s on the creative side, the biz dev side, my job to know how to talk to people about this game. This is my forte.  #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In several ways, Alfageeh and MM are citebodying digital media, feeling collaborative feedback that circulates in public for several weeks, months, and even years. They invent levels on the livestream, announce new updates to OMM, manage campaigns with closed beta players and on the livestream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our main way of feedback is through people playing games. Right now, closed beta has a priority on the games that we offer, they have priority towards the platform as it is in development. We release patch notes every week, we’re constantly iterating adding assets to our library, we are building the game. They get to use the platform while it’s in development. We have a bunch of people who have concurrent campaigns right now, there are people who are streaming our game to their own small audiences. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s as if Alfageeh, in particular, is managing the constant circulation of OMM-in-progress as features and new campaigns are made available for audience feedback. Stacey Pigg frames this as a “coordinating constant invention,” a practice in which professional writers are managing a network of writng tasks and public audiences. Studying the professional writer, Dave, Pigg observed that he was “juggling layered responsibilities of constantly inventing texts, alliances, and his own professional persona. To maintain presence in social networks, he must constantly monitor and participate in their symbolic exchange” (p. 70). I would argue that Alfageeh’s practices align with those of Dave’s, but I would also argue that her work is much wider and deeper in terms of audiences and participation with those audiences. She is doing much more than writing with and to her OMM’s audiences. This is not to discount the important work that Dave was likely doing at the time of Pigg’s study. It’s just that Alfageeh and her team’s project is an ongoing living one that unfolds in circulatory ways. Put differently, it’s a project that might manifest infinite possibilities, infinite updates for and by the developers and audiences before it is considered “finished.”</p>
<p>Alfageeh argues that OMM’s current and future success is dependent on public feedback and revising in response to that feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our top of funnel is you find us on Twitch or on Twitter through one of our trailers, then secondary we tell you go to the discord. That’s how you can go talk to other people who are interested in this stuff. That’s how you can play the game, we get you into a game. We start taking notes on how you’re playing that kind of feedback. And then we wait for people to also tell us their own feedback. Then we begin that cycle all over again, after we implciteent that feedback. We go all the way back again to the top of the funnel, which is Twitch and Twitter in the most public-facing version of our of our game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Alfageeh indicates, OMM’s production cycle has many moving parts and people through which feedback circulates in public. So what about development teams that are much smaller, even solo, and have limited resources?</p>
<p>A turn to developer Justin Amirkhani sheds light on these questions. It’s May 2020 and he’s calling on Discord from his Toronto apartment. Amirkhani is a co-founder of and lead developer for the independent company Vagabond Dog, well known for its role-playing games <cite>Always Sometimes Monsters</cite> (2014) and <cite>Sometimes Always Monsters</cite> (2020), about the rise and fall of independent authors and ways of managing such a spectrum ripe with characters. Amirkhani streams his game development nightly on Twitch and manages a robust community on the Vagabond Dog Discord. Amirkhani’s Twitch channel also includes game playthroughs and industry chats with games creators.</p>
<p>“I spent a lot of time from the first game [<cite>Always Sometimes Monsters</cite>] being treated as an auteur,” Amirkhani tells me.</p>
<p>Amirkhani is referring to <cite>Always Sometimes Monsters</cite>, which received praise across critics and garnered a massive following. Vagabond Dog bought a bus and toured the United States, offering dciteos of the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin Amirkhani: That was my first game;  we came out and we did really, really well. We got all this praise, everyone was like, “go, genius, go!” Then I’m supposed to go and hide in the cave and like work on something brilliant and then come back out, and then that’s it? But that’s not how real life is. It’s a myth. It’s a total garbage myth that we love in society, but I don’t think it’s healthy for the product or the or the creator, and I’m kind of tired of playing into it. So I’m now being super open.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amirkhani is referring to the open nature of streaming on Twitch. Leading up to our first conversation in May 2020, he was streaming his work on writing lines of dialogue and actions for characters through game development software called RPG Maker. RPG Maker was used for <cite>Always Sometimes Monsters</cite> and <cite>Sometimes Always Monsters</cite>. It streamlines level design, character creation, and more for games that hark back to top-down role-playing video games in the 80s and 90s such as <cite>Zelda</cite> and <cite>Final Fantasy</cite> and modern renditions such as <cite>Hotline Miami</cite>. On the stream, we see Amirkhani on webcam and his screen on display, clicking through fields and writing lines in text boxes in RPG Maker for an update to <cite>Sometimes Always Monsters</cite>. Updates are, at their core, revisions in response to user experience. Some sighing about being tired, some laughing with viewers in the chat, some pausing to think aloud about a line or a bit of code.</p>
<p>[Stream clip]</p>
<p>During our conversation, Amirkhani speaks of helping his Twitch audiences understand that even the most mundane of tasks can take hours. There is value in displaying the mundane, he tells me. Just having an audience witness the work is a form of passive, positive feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amirkhani: People tend not to understand the depth and complexity of creating something and then they come on Twitch. They watched me spend seven hours creating a crab merchant who’s got the ability to sell crabs.  But you can also haggle the prices with thcite and other people there with you have their own opinions and commentary on seafood. That’s really benign content that took seven hours. That’s live development that they can witness. That’s a big part of the twitch thing. But it’s also really, again, invigorating to have people care enough about your work to want to sit down and watch the program, which is not something I ever expected people to be interested in. But there is passion and that passion feeds into me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Amirkhani, a seven-hour work session is full of mind waves and weeds, perhaps hesitations about whether or not crab haggling is an interesting topic to stream. However, streaming similar work sessions, and thus staying with feelings associated with the mundane parlayed into passion that accumulated between the developer and his audiences on Twitch. Put differently, feelings take time to accumulate in communities, and livestreaming is a practice that cultivates feedback that passes between creators and audiences. I might suggest that Amirkhani is a streamer who handles accumulation well. In May 2021, he and collaborators streamed for 24 hours straight on Twitch for Vagabond’s forthcoming game The <cite>Infinite Trial of a Hopeless Man Running</cite>, which promises just as the title suggests and features a rainbow-coloured running track. Most nights his streams run for approx. three hours. A stream on July 19, 2021 finds Amirkhani working on character cameos for <cite>Sometimes Always Monsters</cite>. Much of the screen is occupied by the game within RPG Maker, the bottom third running ads for Vagabond Dog’s games and merchandise. The bottom right of the screen features the live chat, where user feedback often lives. A user is suggesting audio clips for a character, saying “let me know if you want a different audio clip” and “I like this one better.” This back and forth between Amirkhani’s edits and the user occurs for about 30 minutes, when they settle on the character’s clothing and vibes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amirkhani: Twitch has a two-fold effect. One, it humanizes us in a way; people don’t really pay attention to who made a game anymore, or maybe they never did, but they look at a game like ours and they have no idea that it’s literally me, and my partner, Jake. And that’s it. They have no idea what I’m going through in order to produce even the most tiny amount of content. Because of our game and the way it works, the variance in it, even if I just want to have a simple interaction … oftentimes if I want to have the person who’s with you [in-game] comment on something, I have to write at least 11 pieces of dialogue, because there’s 11 different characters who could come and say something. Or if we want to have the character have an animation, they have a cigarette or they drink a soda or something like that, I have to do 20 animations for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amirkhani’s comment suggests that it takes time to work through even small tasks. It takes time to stream and ask for feedback. To be fair, Amirkhani isn’t streaming for explicit feedback from users but rather for building community and being more transparent about his work, especially as he builds new content and revises it. In his case, revision is a by-product of streaming. Stream enough and you’re going to generate conversations about your work, potentially revising it later.</p>
<p>Patrick Traynor, an indie developer who’s based in the West Coast in the U.S., brought forth this idea when we spoke in March 2020. Traynor was working on his puzzle game Patrick’s Parabox, which described as “a mind-bending recursive puzzle game about boxes within boxes within boxes within boxes” (Steam). Traynor streams his development practices on Twitch, displaying a range of tasks behind Patrick’s Parabox as well as I Wanna Be The Guy, an open-source platformer developed by  Michael O’Reilly and expanded on by many developers, including Traynor and friends. A recent stream displays Traynor on webcam, with windows of code and level designs behind him, the upper right corner reading “Bugs/Fixed,” and the bottom left corner displaying the soundtrack of his stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patrick Traynor: There are people who get different things out of it. It keeps me on task, and where I might not have done much work that day, it gives me a motivation to actually get something in for a few hours.  Also, if we have a good conversation going and people are watching, it’s great to bounce ideas off of people and just ask for ideas. I’ve gotten a lot of important ideas for multiple games just from my viewers and chatters.</p>

<p>When we discussed his streaming practices, he said it’s not about hyping the game or the argument as much as it is about producing or inventing ideas for a production. Traynor suggested that high expectations for lots of viewers is a means to disappointment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patrick Traynor: If you’re streaming development or something and you want a few people hanging out, it’s tough to have like 0, 1 or 2 viewers, which a lot of times you do. And there’s no easy way around that. You just have to keep doing it and make sure you’re being a good quality streamer that you would want to watch.<br>
<br><br>
Patrick Traynor: The common advice I would give that a lot of people can use when starting out is just do it for reasons other than trying to be popular. If you’re being productive that day, that’s great. If you’re maybe bouncing some ideas off people, that’s great, but don’t set expectations too high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Traynor, livestreaming is about building a community of problcite-solvers, of grappling with the challenges of a game in real-time with one or several dozen viewers. Feelings toward a particular task or idea fluctuate during a livestream as more people join in. Traynor recalls one stream in which a regular follower asked about a puzzle that Traynor dropped from the game. He later revised the game by reintegrating the puzzle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich Shivener  05:16 Can you recall one moment that was pretty powerful with community mcitebers?<br>
<br><br>
05:28 Patrick Traynor:Yeah, I have a great one actually. So for Parabox, two [puzzles] got really popular on Twitter. I don’t know which one you saw on Reddit. But one of thcite was showing a box-containing-itself mechanic. And I had cut that level because I thought, “Oh, it’s not that interesting.” I was streaming a few months after I cut that level and I was kind of wondering “hm, I need to make some more introductory levels for this mechanic” and a viewer suggested “why don’t you bring back this level? You cut it a while ago.” A very astute person who pays attention a lot brought that up. And actually that level was a great level. So I’m really glad they brought that up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sum, the game developers I discuss here suggest that livestreaming is a kind of meta-practice because it opens a window into the rhetorical-affective practices of the day. And because audiences are engaging with the developer and what’s on display, feedback and associated revisions come alive in real time.</p>
