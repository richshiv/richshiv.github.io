<h3>Chapter 2.5: Collaborative Jamming: A Proposal for Writing Studies</h3>    

<p>In the field of writing studies, in what ways have&mdash;and can we&mdash;transform the methods and spirit of in-person and remote game development into something toward webtext productions? Is it possible to test out that creative movement in a manageable way?</p>

<p>It is, but the stakes would be different. This final section of Chapter Two, then, proposes a low-stakes approach to <i>collaborative jamming</i> with fellow scholars, including those who might envision webtexts-as-games. I’m turning here to creators like Douglas Gregory, who works full-time as a game developer at a major studio and makes independent games during the annual Toronto Game Jam, affectionately known as TO Jam. Gregory’s story of the relatively condensed nature of indie game development via the TO Jam offers a heuristic for collaborative work on digital media. As game jams are typically limited to 72 hours, jams are fruitful for invention and experimentation, though, as I acknowledge later, they can be exclusive, male-dominated, and ableist if not approached carefully.</p> 

<p>Let me start by telling Douglas Gregory’s story. Gregory works by day as a designer for the major studio and games publisher Ubisoft. When Anika Rahman and I meet Gregory in June 2021 over Zoom, he is working on <cite>Far Cry 6</cite>, a first-person shooter that revolves around guerrilla fighters in conflict with the regime of the nation Yara (#check, and add link). In his spare time, Gregory has developed short, independent games during TO Jam. TO Jam 2021 ran from May 14 to May 16, 2021 with theme “Once More with Feeling,” which is loosely followed but mainly a meta-commentary on the online edition for the jam for a second year in a row. For several years before the pandemic, it took place at George Brown College in Toronto for 72 hours, starting on a Friday ending Sunday evening. TO Jam’s long-held tradition of pulling together developers for 72 hours is quite similar to institutes such as the Digital Media and Composition Institute and the Digital Humanities Institute, those academic institute where scholars across disciplines gather for proximal composing, seminars and workshops centred on digital media. But the key difference is that, even in its material formations, TO Jam is completely free and contained to three days&mdash;let alone remotely. Gregory describes the TO Jam of then and now this way.</p>

<blockquote> Gregory 13:51: When we're doing the jam at George Brown you'll be sitting side by side with people from other teams making completely different games. You'll be able to kind of look around like, "Hey, is anyone here like good with quaternions?" And some of them put up their hand, we'll work together. You get a lot of pumped up energy from seeing what everybody else is making. We run slideshows on the the big projectors, all the GIFs and screenshots people have been sending. That kind of keeps the hype going. And Discord was kind of doing that job for me this year. In terms of feeling like I was in the community, being able to chit chat, see people sharing their work, tell them how awesome it is, get positive feedback on my work to make sure I'm not going down a rabbit hole and working on the wrong thing.</blockquote>#soundcite

<p>By the end of the jam, Gregory had uploaded his TO Jam submission <cite>That’s My Jam</cite> to the event’s distribution page on the website itch.io. <cite>That’s My Jam</cite> is what Gregory calls a freestyle rhythm dance game, and it might remind you of those <cite>Dance Dance Revolution</cite> games often placed at arcades, malls, and movie theaters. In <cite>That’s My Jam</cite>, you start by controlling a single dancer by pressing any key on the keyboard (check) to the beats of two tracks. Later, more dancers join the party.</p> 

<p>[Show video clip of game with Gregory’s voice over it.]</p> 

<p>For his day job, Gregory is entrenched in massive games like <cite>Far Cry 6</cite>, so why does he do TO Jam? Gregory describes it as a change of pace from his day job, a different kind of collaboration guided by his own desires. At the time of our conversation, <cite>Far Cry 6</cite> is in its third year of development and the company is preparing for an October 2021 release date. Here is Gregory reflecting on the helpful time constraints of jamming on an independent game.</p>

<blockquote>Gregory: 448 So for something like a jam,  I can start with nothing on the Friday and have a new playable thing on the Sunday. And a new thing I can put on my website, on my ith.io page, you know, tweet to people about so it really is concrete progress. I can kind of chalk up and go, like, "Oh, I did something, I accomplished something, I finished something." That's really good for me. The short time constraint makes it a little bit easier to take risks. If I've got an idea, that might just be a terrible idea, I don't want to sink a week into it, you know, or a month or something like that. But if I know worst case, even my if my idea is absolute garbage, I've lost a weekend.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>[Cuts a few sentences and gets to this line] I also like the independence of being able to make a small scope game, just by myself, like, hey, if I want to do it this way, I don't have to have a design meeting and convince the whole team, I can just do it. And if it's terrible well, okay, that's on me, but it's fine. At least you didn't have to pay anything to join the jam.</blockquote> #soundcite
<p>Perhaps it’s the free aspect of TO Jam that allows low-key collaboration and feelings to blossom. As Gregory tells us, an idea can be total garbage before, during, and after TO Jam&mdash;but hopefully it’s useable. His idea accords with the aims of the TO Jam, whose organizers argue that, “We consider the jam a kick-start, and want everyone to continue polishing their diamonds in the rough ”(#check website). Sure, they do want you to finish something in 72 hours and make it available for public feedback, but they frame it as something that can be worked on further after the jam ends.  It is the beginning of feeling feedback and revision, a concept I turn to in Chapter 3. Gregory puts the open-ended production cycle of TO Jam as “the approach of coming at a problem and trying to figure out what's the minimum prototype?”</p>
<blockquote>37: What's the toy here that we can build and see if it's any fun first, as opposed to trying to find a huge overarching feature and build the whole thing. That's something that from practicing in jams, I know I really want to bring that back into my other game work whenever I can, because it's kind of proven to have a bit of a track record at this point that it works. I've seen a lot of features that were very meticulously planned out over the big scope that we didn't do that core fun finding first. And we've suffered as a result.</blockquote> #soundcite
<p>During TO Jam 2021, Gregory and dozens of others seemed to do plenty of fun-finding, prototyping, and collaborating on TO Jam’s official Discord. For 72 hours, as Gregory recalls, developers were sharing screenshots of their works in progress, asking questions and seeking advice, and some were also developing their work live on Twitch simultaneously (see XX; XX). Some participants jammed as “floaters,” creators who, as the name implies, move between projects to help create media assets. For <cite>That’s My Jam</cite>, Gregory used musical tracks by David Vitas and James Stajov, a floater that year. Gregory argues that floating is a small commitment for the participant but a huge help for solo developers like himself. Thinking about Stajov’s contributor and past floater support, Gregory says that, in a way, the collaborative community-building goals of TO Jam were even stronger than its past brick-and-mortar editions at George Brown College. TO Jam on Discord means less time spent moving around physical rooms and such.</p> 
<blockquote>Gregory 18: Like, it's really easy for an all-call [message] on Discord to say yo, “I need a floater that does do X,” and you can put that up where everybody in the jam [on Discord] is gonna see it versus asking in the room you’re in, like, “hey, are there any floaters in this room?” And there are five rooms so you have to run around or that kind of thing. Also, having the history [of chats on Discord] so that I can scroll back up and see a conversation that I wasn't physically present for. I'm sleeping at the time, but I can get caught up. Although I do find it harder to keep synchronous. We had a help channel for getting help troubleshooting issues or implementing features. I tried to stay on top of that one. But every so often, I would come in and go like, “Oh, hey, there's a question I could have answered five hours ago.”</blockquote> #soundcite
<p>And so this is my main point in this final section of Chapter Two. Our field needs more free, remote events like this to support collaborative invention and minimal prototypes. A weekend just to show something. A weekend to say, find fun in a scholarly project. As I claim in Chapter One, brick-and-mortar versions of scholarly institutes are resource intensive, even if it’s an institution-based model. Participant fees support catering, compensate guest speakers, and keep the lights on, the servers running overnight. In contrast, remote jams on Discord are much less costly, save for the platform’s optional subscription packages, relying more on a “Bring Your Own Computer” model. The one caveat, I might suggest is time, which one participant of TO Jam told me is the most stressful part of jams. Here’s Gabriel Branyiczky, who you’ll meet again in Chapters Three and Four. Listen as he is reflecting on his development of the game <cite>Worlds Within Worlds</cite>, another submission for TO Jam 2021.</p> 

<blockquote>Branyiczky 14: That's probably the most stressful part of the jam - that very beginning. Feeling a time crunch and trying to come up with an idea under the time crunch, I think, is the most stressful part of it. And then, very, very close underneath that is the time crunch you run into at the end, where it's like, "Oh man, I thought this was gonna work." And moments before uploading, I realize things are broken. Thankfully, it doesn't happen to me very often. I've participated in somewhere around 15 game jams at this point, and all of those have really helped me to get a good sense of what I'm able to do in any given span of time.</blockquote>

<p>As of writing this book, I have yet to see a temporally intense jam for digital media scholarship, but I find promise in events like the open house meetings with editors at <cite>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy</cite>. During a Zoom call in summer 2021, a number of virtual rooms were established with one or two editors in each room, each answering topical questions (e.g., web design templates) and commenting on webtext ideas, early drafts, etc.</p>

<p>[Look to include a block quote from CA!]</p>

<p>Part of the goal of these open-house meetings is to encourage submissions, especially by junior faculty and BIPOC scholars. This is part of the field’s recent collective mission to be more inclusive in publishing spaces (see XX; XX).</p> 

<p>So can we do more than those meetings? Yes. Have we? Maybe by the time this book hits screens, the field has done a kind of weekend jam that builds on those conversations. Maybe editors and experienced digital media composers are serving as floaters for first-time creators, or maybe first-time creators are serving as floaters in order to scale their time commitments. Maybe, like, some game jams put on by studios, the media assets are already there and ready for remixing in any way shape or form. Maybe minimum prototypes are circulating on a public website, a Twitch channel in which some composers and editors are offering helpful feedback or developing their prototypes live. Maybe it’s a truly inclusive event that allows myriad scholars—and not just white dudes looking to get a job (see XXX #check)&mdash;to touch and feel their way through what they once thought was total garbage. As we will learn more about in Chapters Three and Four, minimum prototypes and small ideas can blossom into projects that live on and evolve for months and years.</p> 

<p>Overall, Chapter Two sheds light on the nature of collaborative work before and amid the pandemic: where it’s in-person or remote, it’s productive and affectively intense. For many creators in game development, this long-held method of collaboration requires the circulation of content and feelings across numerous textual and digital communication channels, from in-text editors in Unity, to Google Docs, to Discord and Zoom calls. The sheer volume of content produced by remote collaboration and hybrid forms can be extraordinary and overwhelming, but it still results in a finished project vibrant with feelings.</p>
