<h3>Living Updates and Documentation</h3>
<p>For many game developers, revisions to finished games are commonplace and well-documented. As Caravella and Holmes (2022) indicate, revisions are a matter of ethos construction in game development. Reviewing the “patch notes” of developer Jeff Kaplan, an update “builds his ethos as a player of the game by specifically gesturing to feedback received by players that lead to technical changes” (p. 7). For game developers such as Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, and Yong Zhen Zhou, updates to their games are not crucial because their games were designed for unique contexts and difficult to replicate on personal computers. However, many developers presenting games at the Game Developers Conference demo their works in progress and updated it after receiving feedback. Having covered feedback on works in progress in Chapter Three, though, I turn now to game developers who have published updates <i>to</i> and  <i>about</i> their games. These approaches ensure that a game lives on in public in some capacity.</p>
<p><i>Living Updates</i></p>
<p>It’s May 2021 and I’m watching Gabriel Branyiczky develop <cite>Worlds Within Worlds,</cite> a game he began developing during the 2021 Toronto Game Jam, first discussed in Chapter Three. Worlds Within Worlds is a two-dimensional “platformer” in which you move through worlds to “collect Golden Leaves to restore Trees.” (The game is free to play, but donations help future developments.) Branyiczky has participated in several game jams in Toronto and online spaces, including the very popular Ludum Dare, an international game jam that gives developers one month to conceive and distribute an independent game with certain themes and parameters. During TO Jam game, Branyiczky is livestreaming his development in ways we heard about in Chapter Three: talking aloud about the game’s mechanics, showing programs and code that make the game possible, and interacting with viewers. When a version of <cite>Worlds Within Worlds</cite> is published on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, it’s just the beginning for what John Gallagher (2020) would call <cite>Worlds Within Worlds’</cite> afterlife.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would say that developers tend to approach their jam games in a few different mindsets. You know, there’s the people who are just making it for fun for a passion project, maybe even a portfolio piece someday down the line. And when they’re continuing work on a jam game, it’s because they want it to be a more complete version, so that if anyone sees it in the future, it’ll reflect well, on their work as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July 2021, Branyiczky continues working on a more complete version of <cite>Worlds Within Worlds.</cite> We meet over Zoom for a meet-and-greet introductory interview, and then he invites me to join him on Twitch for a conversation about the game later in the week. It’s a means to interviewing him and allowing him to explain his process while his regular audience participates. In this excerpt, we are discussing his decision to prepare parts of the game before TO Jam and then expand on them after the event. Listen as he describes revising and adding levels to <cite>Worlds Within Worlds.</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich: I noticed with Worlds Within Worlds you said in the description that you developed some of the assets of the game ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Branyiczky: Oh yes, so much of your game is built ahead of time, like the the only thing that I was doing for the jam was the level design. Everything else is built.<br>
<br>
Rich: How many levels do or do you anticipate having for worlds within worlds?[Splice audio together.<br>
<br>
Branyiczky: Well, so right now, there are three worlds and the version of the game that is out there, you can play in each world has five levels in it. And then right now, I’ve just finished world four. So that’s the total up to 20. And I want you to at least, finish world five and see where I’m at with that. Um, so there’s going to be at least 25 levels in the game. But if I still feel like I have more ideas and more, sort of, like, elements of the game that I want to play this like that was one thing you can see on here is that world one is introducing a lot of the basic mechanics of the game. World two is jellies then a puzzle, a challenge involving wind, then another challenge involving jellies then another challenge involving wind and then challenge involving jellies tossed whipped. And then same thing with World three, it’s the little boost blocks you have to hit and then jump on them before they fade away, then it’s a little curl ups, then it’s those blocks to then I took the goats out of here and move them into a different part of the game. But then you’ve got the sort of challenge of the roll ups and the DOS dos. And it’s the same thing. World four is a like introducing one element, then introducing other elements, then playing a harder version of maps of each and then seeing how those two elements interact. And it’ll be the same world five, and it might even be the same with another world as long as I can continue to come up with these sorts of elements that are fun on their own, and then are fun in combination with one another. No.<br>
<br>
GB: there’s a massive list of all the levels that I have in the game that are in the engine, I should say. And some of them are scrapped. Some of them are original versions of others that I’ve redone since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[GIF and Caption: GB’s process working on <cite>Worlds Within Worlds</cite>.]</p>
<p>Branyiczky’s experiences underscore the value of living digital media even as a solo developer. It doesn’t take a massive team to make living digital media, but it can be massive undertaking on one’s part—weeks and weeks of streaming, pushing constant and periodic updates, to get work done. To boot, audiences who play the game—even audiences that are smaller in size—contribute to the game and its developers’ liveliness. This confluence of interactive feedback and public collaboration amount to the affective charges (Stewart, 2007) that the practice of living digital media depends on. Branyiczky argues that he streams and updates the games even when noone’s watching. Perhaps it is streaming that kickstarts the heartbeat of his constant updates to a game that was finished during a game jam. To offer a sense of Branyiczky living digital media, and the positive vibes that stem from it, I invite you to listen this section with one final excerpt from our chat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The thing that’s really beneficial about keeping myself on such a rigid schedule is the fact that it means that - however small the steps that I am accomplishing on any given stream are - it’s giving me an opportunity to just keep making steps forward. I definitely have gone through various phases, like years, of my life, where I just feel like I’m not getting very much done, not working towards the dreams, not engaging in hobbies, and not working towards whatever it is I really want to be making. I find that taking time out to participate in the stream and the fact that I’ve actually got an audience here, I feel somewhat accountable to maintain the consistency of the stream to be here, in some small form, as an entertainer, but also as a part of this community. It’s a great opportunity for me to mostly focus on actually working towards the development of my own games, but also for me to participate in conversations with chats and with other game developers and do interviews. It’s been a very positive thing for me. I figured, even if I only have like one, two viewers - in this case, we’re up to five, which is great - even if I had next to nobody watching me, I’d still keep doing this specifically because of the fact that it’s afforded me this time to work on my art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sum, Branyiczky has made virtual space for living digital media and the updates that come alive in real time. Like Branyiczky, many devs featured in this book have published updates to their games. I refer once again to House House’s <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite> and its August 2020 update: “Oh dear! Two horrible geese!</p>
<p>Soon you’ll be able to enjoy <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite> with a friend, in a new two-player cooperative mode. Play through the whole game as two horrible geese, honking twice as much, teaming up to plan pranks, and generally ruining everyone’s day, together” (Nintendo, 2020). As I emphasized in this book, developers need considerable time to update their projects, let alone while streaming in public. The perpetual motion of living digital media means perpetual invention. However, a project can live on in less intense yet meaningful ways. This is why documentation about games is important to acknowledge.</p>
<p><i>On Documentation</i></p>
<p>In addition to updating actual games, developers also write comprehensive documents detailing their updates and reflecting on their overall development processes. On the <cite>Worlds Within Worlds</cite> page, Branyiczky publishes “change logs” to the game, a recent one featuring updates such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><cite>Individual Level Best-Time Tracking: Your best attempt at clearing each level will be recorded and shown above each level’s gate in the overworld with Speedrun Mode enabled</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Quick Erase Progress: Erase all progress to make a fresh run at the game; Number “0” key or “R” while paused</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Bug Fixes;</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>The cursor no longer remains invisible if you pause or reset the game while the butterfly is active</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>The in-game timer no longer counts frames to determine time passed and so should be more accurate</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Fixed instantaneous level transitions</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Minor tweak to level 1-5 to make a speedrun path more consistent</cite></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Branyicsky’s change logs are similar to the patch notes of Kaplan that “purposefully construct a particular narrative and rationale for both technical and aesthetic changes made to the game” (Caravella &amp; Holmes, 2022). However they are labeled, such writings are updates that responsive to the developer’s new ideas and feedback from players. Some are objective, simply describing what changes were made. Others, like Kaplan, take a multimodal approach, placing their bodies and voices on screen. The latter approach is an affectively rich delivery practice that helps recirculate content updates to global audiences. While global circulation can spawn satiric remixes of updates (see Caravella &amp; Holmes, 2022), it can also create “flows and rhythms that cultivate new ideas for a serial installment [or update]” (Bahl &amp; Shivener, 2020).</p>
<p>Sheikh and Vicker demonstrated the value of latter as they released versions of <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> on the website <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> and documented their process on a GitHub page, where visitors can check out their raw files and version changes. As Sheikh and Vicker tell me during our conversation on Zoom, documentation is the concurrent text of a project, a means to recalling successes and failures. It is also a way of giving back to the community that supports a game’s development. Put differently, if fellow game devs support a development during a production cycle, then documentation is a good way to pay that support forward. While documentation is more low-key than content updates to a game, but it’s still a crucial public service as much as it is crucial for raising a developer’s profile in the industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zayna Sheikh: The process of making a game is so variable and it takes you on crazy paths through different ideas and different prototypes and different experiences, and all of that is so awesome and valuable that if you do documentation while it’s happening, you have this amazing record of, sure we made this thing, but also we went on this journey to making this thing and learning about what it takes to bring this idea forward, that the better documentation you do, the more you can look back on that and have that as its own body of work to show other people and to help other people with their own development and to have as this updating body of work that you can look at and be like, “Here, this is how I did this. This is what it took to make this project. This was my thought process in making this thing a reality,” and there’s so much value in that, that I have grown to appreciate as I’ve continued to work on creative projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> might not be updated much after GDC, but its presence will live on as long as the two sustain the documentation about it on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> and Github. Combined with the game’s digital files on such sites, their documentation ensures that their game remains a living project, capable of being replicated or referenced for future projects. Without such documentation, future developers might be less aware of how Alt.Ctrl and experimental projects take shape. This is a call I return to in the final section of Chapter 4.</p>
