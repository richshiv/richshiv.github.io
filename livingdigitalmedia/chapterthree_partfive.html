<h3>Should Writing Studies Livestream? Reflecting on the Start of ‘100 Days of Writing’ Project</h3>
<p>The previous sections of this chapter emphasize that livestreaming is a rhetorical-affective practice that results in real-time feedback for digital media projects. This section turns back to the field of writing studies, operating with the question: what can we learn from regular streamers who livestream with public audiences, who have long developed collaborative feedback practices with those viewing and commenting on their work? What tasks of academic research and webtext productions are appropriate for livestreaming and thus receiving feedback on in order to revise? To answer such questions, I discuss the start of the 100 Days of Writing project created by me on Twitch under the username TheeRhetoric in summer 2021. The takeaways that follow are for writing studies scholars who might be interested in doing this kind of work in public and with public audiences.</p>
<p><i>About ‘100 Days of Writing’</i></p>
<p>The 100 Days of Writing project was a series of 100 livestreams featuring scenes of composing this book, related articles, and conversations with writing studies scholars. Livestreams were first available on Twitch and later archived on YouTube, as the former deletes videos on demand between two weeks and 60 days (depending on your account). I streamed several times a week, typically Mondays and Wednesdays, usually broadcasting from my home and through the free Streamlabs OBS platform. During each stream, I shared my webcam and screen, which typically displayed a writing program and a work in progress. I livestreamed editing, coding webpages, and freewriting for sections in a chapter. Streams lasted for approximately one hour, depending on the task at hand. If I had a guest on the stream, I also made their audio, webcam, and screen available if they were comfortable with that visibility. Here are some brief excerpts from the project.</p>
<p>[Brief excerpt from the project embedded here.]</p>
<p>I started 100 Days with two goals in mind: 1) to put into practice the calls I made in a previous published article (Shivener, 2020) and Chapter One, in which I call for the field to contribute more behind-the-scenes stories of scholarship, especially digital scholarship. Following that call, I was inspired by Jeremy Tirrell’s and Nathaniel Rivers’ <cite>Following Mechanical Turks</cite> project, which analyzes human intelligence tasks in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service. Since 2019, the scholars have been holding “live streaming video discussions to move through the composition process from initial idea to finished product” <a href="https://manifold.as.uky.edu/read/project-overview/section/62ac5b2d-4c74-4588-b40d-260320b08023">(</a>“<a href="https://manifold.as.uky.edu/read/project-overview/section/62ac5b2d-4c74-4588-b40d-260320b08023">A Pilot Project in Open Scholarship</a>”). Also including project drafts and annotations by publics, <cite>Mechanical Turks</cite> is indeed a model for doing open scholarship in rhetoric and writing studies. By echoing their commitment to openness, I hoped to offer another model for scholars interested in public composing and/or digital scholarship. Born-digital scholarship is not constrained by print boundaries and conventions, so several models might be useful for future scholars.</p>
                                
<p>The second goal I had for 100 Days of Writing was quite simple: holding myself accountable. Every stream, completing 100 days of writing and <cite>Living Digital Media</cite>cite> seemed more achievable. Also, accountability meant following through with the stories and related suggestions of creators I interviewed in 2020 and 2021. As game developers told me, streaming supports task completion, especially as audiences help you solve problems (i.e., complete revisions). Why not put into practice what they suggest?  For me, answering that question meant streaming just to complete, say, a paragraph or a bothersome block of code. By streaming several days a week, I was working more diligently on the book and related projects. More importantly, the project held me accountable for streaming parts of the book that seemed interesting for public display and discussion. Not all parts made for a good stream, so I had to think ahead about the work I could do between offline sessions and on the livestream. Visually, doing line-editing was less interesting than doing a freewriting sprint in <cite>Scrivener</cite> or a writing prompt program like <cite>Written? Kitten!</cite>. Even if streaming supported my task completion, it came with an implicit expectation to be at least somewhat interesting for public audiences.</p>
                                
<p><i>Low-key Streaming Combats the Pressure of Writing in Public</i></p>
<p>Completing low-key tasks can still be interesting and combat the aforementioned expectation. For example, working out an introduction to a section of a chapter might be less daunting to complete while on stream. On stream, deep thinking that often accompanies writing and coding might be quite difficult, especially if the composer is managing a chat room and the various controls and displays of the live-stream. Even small sections, such as 100-500 words might be work well in this space. In a review of many livestreams while streaming this book, as well as conversations I had with developers and creatives, regular, unfettered writing and composing doesn’t happen for long periods here—unless, say, the microphone and camera are turned off. Some writers do as such when livestreaming, displaying their process and work for 25-minute sessions at a time. I’m thinking here of streaming writers such as Supernaturalwriter, TheTigerWrites and SwiftnessAuthor that stream fiction and novel writing sessions. Their streams rely on what comes together, what comes alive on screen, rather than any reading and writing aloud protocols. The timed model might bea good model for focusing on deeper tasks at hand while offering an interesting stream. Some writers even keep their cameras off completely during streams. No-cam approaches might lessen the pressures of writing on screen if the task, rather than the streamer, is the focal point of the livestream.</p>
<p>Furthermore, purposefully seeking out smaller communities might relieve some additional pressure from the expectation of offering an interesting stream. Here’s Gabriel Santos again, this time offering some advice about joining smaller communities on Twitch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another thing I recommend on Twitch is start with smaller communities. So in my case, one thing that’s worked for me is targeting content that doesn’t have that many viewers, so like the science and technology section….So science and technology is one that’s worked personally for me because I’m doing ASCII art. And so what happens is if I can get like, five or six people, suddenly I’m on the first row, I’m on the top row of the category. So if a user is already watching, like some other science and technology thing, and you might get rated by somebody in that category as well, so if you’re doing something cool, or discussing something interesting, people in that category might raid you with like two or three people, you know, and then you you get up to nine and you get up to 10 people 12…. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Santos was reinforcing what I heard from developers such as Patrick Traynor and Danny Weinbaum. Start small, and don’t let performance expectations preclude task completion.</p>
<p><i>Considering Ethics of Qualitative Research Data</i></p>
<p>To that end, I realized during 100 Days of Writing that some task are simply out of the question for livestreaming. Simply put, it would have been unethical to livestream raw data I gathered through interviews, survey responses, etc. I didn’t—and still don’t—see this happening in spaces like Twitch and YouTube. Creative writing authors are less likely to face this ethical issue because they’re inventing original content on and off screen. The same goes for game devs and musicians who invent live on screen. By contrast, qualitative researchers like myself are entwining the words of participants with our analyses, meaning we might have our research data next to our manuscript. Analyzing raw data, that is to say, was a challenge for live-streaming. For example, when I was live-streaming parts of composing this book on Twitch, I resisted citing the names of participants from interviews, the main reason being that I was still drafting the chapter and planned to share it with creators before final publication. A temporary work-around was to use initials and other redactions until I returned to the manuscript. Even though Twitch deleted my videos on demand, I don’t think my concerns were moot. Someone could have still clipped and archived the streams, perhaps sharing it later with public audiences ahead of publication.</p>
<p>An exception to this practice might working with anonymous and public data collected for analysis. A recent example was my analysis of President Joe Biden’s live-stream on Twitch. We collected the chat room transcript and his speech transcript, which were part of the public record. Names in the chat-room transcript were removed before going on stream.</p>
<p>[Video example?]</p>
<p><i>Toward Editing Webtexts and Moving Ideas</i></p>
<p>And now let me get to a point that is more relevant to <cite>Feeling Digital Media</cite>. For the purposes of livestreaming works like academic webtexts, the task of editing and coding a webtext seems veryappropriate and ethical, perhaps more in line with the kind of work done by game developers who stream on a daily basis. Through streaming 100 Days of Writing, I moved between editing webpages in Brackets, writing in Scrivener and Google Docs, Microsoft Excel, and even working with pen and paper and transcribing it on screen. Editing can be somewhat lower-stakes, even an opportunity to crowdsource some editing. As referenced earlier in this chapter, game developers take chat-room suggestions gracefully, working together to, say, fix a sound module or a resolve a pesky area of code. When I was editing webpages for this book, that is, editing HTML was a little less pesky when I was in good company.</p>
<p>[Visual Examples Here]</p>
<p>Editing code and displaying live previews of webtext production is also visual appealing for live-streaming. No one, including writers and developers and audiences, want to stare at lines of code in a live-stream, right? However, shuffling between lines of code and in-process webpages is more interesting for public consumption, for audiences are learning how texts move between many platforms before final publication. The movement of a webtext has public appeal, and that appeal is amplified when streamers hold conversations and think-alouds about tasks behind a webtext. As I noted in previous sections, chatting about a task is a part of invention, a way to work out or move an idea forward. Without audience feedback, without acknowledging who joins you on these live streams, you might lose some valuable ideas.</p>
<p><i>A Final Word</i></p>
<p>Overall, live-streaming exposes the messy and sporadic nature of writing and composing webtexts. Whether it’s a writing sprint or editing session for what seems like an impossible paragraph, it might have an audience. Low-stakes activities such as free writing and visual editing seem more appealing in a space like Twitch. The 100 Days of Writing project was a space to test out rather than polish ideas, to initiate conversations about writing and hold myself accountable for getting text on the page—or at least trying to. Chapter Three drives this point further by focusing on collaboration in material spaces before and after the height of the pandemic, a time when many content creators have longed for working with bodies in proximity.</p>
