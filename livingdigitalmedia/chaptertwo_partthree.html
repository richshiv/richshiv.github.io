</div>
                                
<p>Hi there, this is Rich Shivener, and you’re listening to Chapter Two, Part Three of Feeling Digital Media. This part is titled “Turning to Stories of Real-Time Creators.” </p>


<p>Outside of writing studies, creators in professions such as games and comics have been live-streaming their projects for years. In fact, when I was drafting this chapter in May 2021, creators across both were coming together for a live-streamed event called Comics X Games, which is part of the Toronto Comic Arts Festival and organized by the Hand Eye Society, a Toronto-based nonprofit organization that promotes experimental games and marginalized creators. Comics X Games unfolded over seven days, featuring live talks, play-throughs, and panels over several hours each day. Overlapping with that event was the Toronto Game Jam, a festival in which game creators create a game with a 72-hour deadline. Professional conferencing limitations wrought by COVID-19 indeed bred plenty of creativity on Twitch.</p>
    
<blockquote>Gabriel Branyiczky: If I can’t get this game out in front of playtesters, because it’s a jam game and I have 48 hours to do so, then the two or three people writing back responses and giving a feedback in the chat saying, “Oh, that doesn't really make sense to me, how’s that gonna work?” is super helpful, because then I can say, “Oh, all right, let’s put in an extra bit of feedback here and extra bit of feedback there.” Again, just all trying to smooth out the process of communicating the way that I know the game functions in a way that a player can understand as well.</blockquote>
                                
<p>That was Attila Gabriel Branyiczky, who streams his game development process under the name Bluish Green Productions. Part three of this chapter presents stories of creators and their commentaries from interviews I conducted in 2020 and 2021. All creators I reference here stream or have streamed regularly––say, a few hours each week––on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. We should probably start with a basic question about live-streaming that came out of several interviews.</p> 

<p>Why the hell do creators live-stream? How do they feel about it?</p>

<p>It’s May 2020 and Justin Amirkhani is calling on Discord from his Toronto apartment. Amirkhani is a co-founder of and lead developer for the independent company Vagabond Dog, well known for its role-playing games Always Sometimes Monsters (2014) and Sometimes Always Monsters (2020), about the rise and fall of independent authors and ways of managing such a spectrum ripe with characters. Justin Amirkhani streams his game development nightly on Twitch and manages a robust community on the Vagabond Dog Discord. Amirkhani’s Twitch channel also includes game play-throughs and  industry chats with games creators.</p>
                                
<blockquote>Justin Amirkhani: I spent a lot of time from the first game on to it being treated as an auteur. 
    Amirkhani is referring to Always Sometimes Monsters, which received praise across critics and garnered a massive following. Vagabond Dog bought a bus and toured the United States, offering demos of the game.</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>Justin Amirkhani: That was my first game;  we came out and we did really, really well. We got all this praise, everyone was like, “go, genius, go!” Then I'm supposed to go and hide in the cave and like work on something brilliant and then come back out, and then that's it? But that's not how real life is. It's a myth. It's a total garbage myth that we love in society, but I don't think it's healthy for the product or the or the creator, and I'm kind of tired of playing into it. So I'm now being super open.”</blockquote>
                                
<p>Amirkhani is referring to the open nature of streaming on Twitch. Leading up to our first conversation in May 2020, he was streaming his work on writing lines of dialogue and actions for characters through game development software called RPG Maker. RPG Maker was used for Always Sometimes Monsters and Sometimes Always Monsters. It streamlines level design, character creation, and more for games that hark back to top-down role-playing video games in the 80s and 90s such as Zelda and Final Fantasy and modern renditions such as Hotline Miami. On the stream, we see Amirkhani on webcam and his screen on display, clicking through fields and writing lines in text boxes in RPG Maker for an update to Sometimes Always Monsters. Some sighing about being tired, some laughing with viewers in the chat, some pausing to think aloud about a line or a bit of code.</p> 

<p>Amirkhani spoke about helping his Twitch audiences understand that even the most mundane of tasks can take hours. There is value in displaying the mundane, he told me. Viewing is implicit feedback.</p>
    
<blockquote>Amirkhani: People tend not to understand the depth and complexity of creating something and then they come on Twitch. They watched me spend seven hours creating a crab merchant who's got the ability to sell crabs.  But you can also haggle the prices with them and other people there with you have their own opinions and commentary on seafood. That's really benign content that took seven hours. That's live development that they can witness. That's a big part of the twitch thing. But it's also really, again, invigorating to have people care enough about your work to want to sit down and watch the program, which is not something I ever expected people to be interested in. But there is passion and that passion feeds into me.</blockquote>
    
<p>For Amirkhani, a seven-hour work session is full of mind waves and weeds, perhaps hesitations about whether or not crab haggling is an interesting topic to stream. However, streaming similar work sessions, and thus staying with feelings associated with the mundane parlayed into passion that accumulated between the developer and his viewers on Twitch. Put differently, feelings take time to accumulate in communities, and feedback is a practice that cultivates affective relationships between creators and viewers. I might suggest that Amirkhani is a streamer who handles accumulation well. In May 2021, he and collaborators streamed for 24 hours straight on Twitch for Vagabond’s forthcoming game The Infinite Trial of a Hopeless Man Running, which promises just as the title suggests and features a rainbow-coloured running track. Most nights his streams run for approx. three hours. A stream on July 19, 2021 finds Amirkhani working on character cameos for Sometimes Always Monsters. Much of the screen is occupied by the game within RPG Maker, the bottom third running ads for Vagabond Dog’s games and merchandise. The bottom right of the screen features the live chat, where user feedback often lives. A user is suggesting audio clips for a character, saying “let me know if you want a different audio clip” and “I like this one better.” This back and forth between Amirkhani’s edits and the user occurs for about 30 minutes, when they settle on the character’s clothing and vibes.</p>
    
<blockquote>Amirkhani: Twitch has a two-fold effect. One, it humanizes us in a way; people don't really pay attention to who made a game anymore, or maybe they never did, but they look at a game like ours and they have no idea that it's literally me, and my partner, Jake. And that's it. They have no idea what I'm going through in order to produce even the most tiny amount of content. Because of our game and the way it works, the variance in it, even if I just want to have a simple interaction .... oftentimes if I want to have the person who's with you [in game] comment on something, I have to write at least 11 pieces of dialogue, because there's 11 different characters who could come and say something. Or if we want to have the character have an animation, they have a cigarette or they drink a soda or something like that, I have to do 20 animations for that.</blockquote>

<p>Amirkhani’s comment suggests that it takes time to work through even small tasks. It takes time to stream and ask and receive feedback. To be fair, Amirkhani isn’t streaming for explicit feedback from users but rather for building community and being more transparent about his work. For better or worse, feedback is a by-product of streaming. Stream enough and you’re going to generate conversations about your work.</p>

<p>However, some creators I spoke with do make collaborative feedback an explicit part of their streaming enterprise.</p> 

<p>Patrick Traynor, an indie developer who’s based in the West Coast in the U.S., brought forth this idea when we spoke in March 2020. Traynor was working on his puzzle game Patrick’s Parabox, which described as “a mind-bending recursive puzzle game about boxes within boxes within boxes within boxes” (Steam). Traynor streams his development practices on Twitch, displaying a range of tasks behind Patrick’s Parabox as well as I Wanna Be The Guy, an open-source platformer developed by  Michael O'Reilly and expanded on by many developers, including Traynor and friends. A recent stream displays Traynor on webcam, with windows of code and level designs behind him, the upper right corner reading “Bugs/Fixed,” and the bottom left corner displaying the soundtrack of his stream.</p> 
    
<blockquote>Patrick Traynor: There are people who get different things out of it. It keeps me on task, and where I might not have done much work that day, it gives me a motivation to actually get something in for a few hours.  Also, if we have a good conversation going and people are watching, it's great to bounce ideas off of people and just ask for ideas. I've gotten a lot of important ideas for multiple games just from my viewers and chatters.</blockquote>

<p>When we discussed his streaming practices, he said it’s not about hyping the game or the argument as much as it is about producing or inventing ideas for a production. Traynor suggested that high expectations for lots of viewers is a means to disappointment.</p> 
    
<blockquote>Patrick Traynor: If you're streaming development or something and you want a few people hanging out, it's tough to have like 0, 1 or 2 viewers, which a lot of times you do. And there's no easy way around that. You just have to keep doing it and make sure you're being a good quality streamer that you would want to watch.</blockquote>
                                
<blockquote>Patrick Traynor: The common advice I would give that a lot of people can use when starting out is just do it for reasons other than trying to be popular. If you're being productive that day, that’s great. If you're maybe bouncing some ideas off people, that’s great, but don’t set expectations too high.</blockquote>

<p>For Traynor, it’s more about building a community of problem-solvers, of grappling with challenges of a game in real-time with one or several dozen viewers. Feelings toward a particular task or idea fluctuate during a live-stream as more people join in. Traynor recalled one stream in which a regular follower asked about a puzzle that Traynor dropped from the game:</p> 

<blockquote>Rich Shivener  05:16Can you recall one moment that was pretty powerful with community members?</blockquote>
                                
<blockquote>Patrick Traynor:Yeah, I have a great one actually. So for Parabox, two [puzzles] got really popular on Twitter. I don't know which one you saw on Reddit. But one of them was showing a box-containing-itself mechanic. And I had cut that level because I thought, "Oh, it's not that interesting." I was streaming a few months after I cut that level and I was kind of wondering "hm, I need to make some more introductory levels for this mechanic" and a viewer suggested "why don't you bring back this level? You cut it a while ago." A very astute person who pays attention a lot brought that up. And actually that level was a great level. So I'm really glad they brought that up.</blockquote>

<p>Staying on task and/or building communities of support —of which we can argue is a form of feedback—came up numerous times in my interviews with creators when I asked about Twitch. Talking over Skype from his home in Seattle, Danny Weinbaum said Twitch gave him momentum as he was working on tasks for his open-world, narrative game, Eastshade, about a painter who returns home after an accident at sea. Listen as Weinbaum speaks about “cranking” in relation to viewership. His experience started at home and moved to Twitch.</p>
    
<blockquote>Danny Weinbaum:….but actually the reason why I started Twitch streaming this is because I noticed once someone's watching me I basically crank non-stop. It started because my partner, Jacqueline, sometimes we would be working on something together and we would get so much done because I was in the driver's seat and then we were discussing and I would want to go as fast as possible because you know, we're moving, getting stuff done. I'm not gonna browse Twitter or whatever. And I thought, "well gosh, if I could just have people watching me all the time. I wonder if I would just like crank, if I'd be unstoppable," and so I started Twitch streaming and it worked extremely well because the faster I went the more interesting it was. For some really gnarly programming problems the eyeball actually makes it harder to solve the problems, but for certain tasks, streaming works really well. And that's basically why I kept streaming.</blockquote>
                                
<p>Weinbaum’s comments raise a good point about Twitch. In a way, it’s a performance space, with implicit expectations that you do something while on stream––chat, code, edit––let alone keep it interesting. Twitch affords self-surveillance and voluntary public surveillance for getting tasks done, for staying motivated to complete a project. Creators monitor what they do on screen while being aware of the real-time audience reactions to what they do. It’s easy to get caught up in the metrics of the latter. The software Streamlabs OBS, for example, helps creators track the number of viewers and new followers on a live stream and replicates the live chat column available on Twitch and YouTube. (If you’re listening or reading to this chapter on my book’s website, then you can see an embedded video of me discussing Streamlabs for my related series “100 Days of Writing” that I’ve begun streaming on Twitch and YouTube. That’s in the section titled “Ephemera: Chapter Two.”)</p>

<p>Enter the challenge, perhaps the paradox, of live streaming. If a creator is paying attention to those aesthetics and metrics of their live stream, then they might do less composing than they do off screen.</p> 

<p>To shed light on this idea, I want to play a clip from an interview with Ian Endsley and Carter Lodwick, two game developers beyond the award-winning game Wide Ocean, Big Jacket, a short, narrative-driven game about music, camping, and relationships. Ian and Carter used to stream on Twitch but recently scaled back that practice to focus on a recent project. Here’s Ian,[ Need to change to their last names.] followed by Carter, talking about how Twitch affected their processes. They work together in an apartment in Los Angeles.</p> 

<blockquote>Rich Shivener  30:23: How do you feel about live streaming your own work in development? I saw that you have you have a Twitch, link and so forth. Yeah. What's your take on that approach for game development?</blockquote>
                                
<blockquote>Ian Endsley: I love watching people do that and I actually really liked doing it. I think it keeps me focused and it's fun to talk out what I'm trying to do while I'm doing it. But I'm also just not super-comfortable in front of the camera in that way,  so I really have to do a lot of prep work and planning to feel like I have a task to do.  I'd like to get in a place where I stream more. I really enjoyed when we did that a couple years ago, and I think it's awesome that people do it. I love watching people do that. But then like, I don't know when it's the morning and I actually have to do it, I clam up a little bit.</blockquote>
                                
<blockquote>Rich Shivener: Carter, what do you think about that?</blockquote>
                                
<blockquote>Carter Lodwick: I haven't done too much streaming of my work process. I've done it a couple times, and I do enjoy it, but it generally to me feels more like a public service rather than as a way to help my own process, you know? When I do it, I'm 80% focusing on describing what I'm doing and  trying to make it clear to people who are watching and 20% actually being able to, like, focus on  the best way that I want to solve this problem.</blockquote>

<p>Endsley and Lodwick’s comments are interesting because digital rhetoric and writing process theorists have argued ad nauseam that the writer never writes alone, that external forces, tools, notifications, audiences, are fundamental, often unseen elements of composing. Live-streaming puts the external and internal on full display, mostly likely in public. Weinbaum and many other creators not mentioned here suggest that preparing and displaying their work as a live performance is worth the effort, especially if live-streaming helps push their work forward. Aesthetics and metrics, that is, are not distractions but vital, affective forces that support their work. This is not to say that Weinbaum and others only do work when they’re streaming on Twitch––Twitch is rhetorically and affectively additive to their composing practices.</p> 

                                <p>At this point, I’m thinking I should turn to negative side of live-streaming content creation. Besides feeling unable to complete a task, creators opt out of streaming because of the very audiences they invited behind the scenes.</p>
