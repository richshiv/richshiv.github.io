<h3>Missing Bodies and Pandemic Collaborations</h3>         

<p>On a sunny evening in May 2020, I’m speaking with Michael McMaster, one of four developers and friends who run the company House House. House House is known for developing the wrestling-ball game <cite>Push Me Pull You</cite> and <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite>, a relatively short game in which a goose causes all sorts of trouble in a small village. McMaster and his collaborators are based in Melbourne, Australia. If you check out the end credits of both games, you’ll find a massive list of collaborators. McMaster tells me that it literally takes a village to make an indie game, speaking about the Melbourne community.</p>

<blockquote>There is this nice creative community and scene of game development within Melbourne that we've relied on and leaned on and drawn from when we've been hiring contractors for different bits of work. Certainly throughout <cite>Push Me Pull You</cite>, which is our first game, when we started we didn't come from a game-making background. We were sort of starting from scratch. We really relied on the community to welcome us into into that scene and show us around and introduce us to people and that kind of thing. We were very reliant on that scene to help us through the first game.</blockquote> #soundcite

<p>More often than not, game development is a deeply collaborative, creative process that unfolds over months and years. Before the pandemic, many developers and their collaborators were working alongside each other, in apartments, small offices, and massive buildings. Chapter 2.2 emphasizes much negativity that stems from such collaborations (see O’Donnell, 2014). But McMaster’s story demonstrates the situatedness of such feelings. Here he is reflecting on the most pleasurable part of working on <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite>. It wasn’t the many accolades that followed its release. Even though <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite> was awarded Game of the Year, the most pleasure came from collaboration, he tells me.</p>
<blockquote><b>FIX MM 49</b>: To be honest, the most pleasurable thing has been like we, the four of us were friends before we started making video games and we've managed to stay friends and enjoy each other’s company and working together. It's been very nice to be able to actually enjoy going into the office and spending time with these three people who I spend every other day with and not completely hate them through that process of collaborating on a creative project.</blockquote>  #soundcite
<p>McMaster points out that much of <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite> was finished before the pandemic, aside from a two-player update released in summer 2020. In contrast to his positive story, numerous stories of the pandemic's effects on game development are those of production delays as well as nostalgia for working in proximity to one another. Speaking with Matt Kim (2021) for the game news site <cite>IGN</cite>, <cite>Final Fantasy 14</cite> director Naoki Yoshida said, “Those times where you’re sitting in front of the computer, and your teammates are there, and a programmer would just pull in their teammates, saying, ‘Hey, can you come look at my screen and check this out?’ You can’t do that in a work-from-home situation.” Collaboration and interpersonal circulation therein have transformed into virtual worlds.</p> 

<p>Sharing similar stories, this part of Chapter Two relays stories of creators who were working together prior to the pandemic and separated after. Much of the stories I relay here are based on interviews in 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic was looming globally, and later, when lockdowns were in full effect in Canada and beyond. That means most of the interviews I did with creators were remote. (You can read more about my methodological shifts in the Ephemera section of this chapter.) Nevertheless, the interview were still meaningful and full of details about collaborative practices and feelings that circulated among creators.</p>

<p>It's a Tuesday in February 2020 and I'm speaking with Adam Volker and Bohdon Sayre, the developers behind the game <cite>Creature in the Well</cite>, a post-apocalyptic, dungeon crawling game that they describe as “pinball with swords.” You play as a sword-wielding robot tasked with powering on an ancient machine before a sandstorm devastates a city. A game about environmental shifts and deadly automation, <cite>Creature in the Well</cite>weaves a haunting narrative with scenes of bouncing energy orbs and explosions.</p> 

<p>Volker and Sayre are developers for Flight School Studio, a large collective of studios that work in graphic design, animation and gaming. Volker works as art director, while Sayre leads the programming. Here’s Sayre: “When Adam's waiting for me to finish all the boring technical aspects of the end of the production, he's making a lot of art for the next collection. It involves a lot of cool world building and concept and stuff like that. #soundcite</p> 

<p>When we spoke, the two were sharing an office in Montreal, having immigrated recently from Dallas, Texas. The office was blooming with creative energy&mdash;a white board with character sketches and notes, passerby from the film studio down the hall, computers displaying works in progress. Volker and Sayre attended the same university&mdash;but interestingly, met after graduation&mdash;and have worked in game design together since (year). As a two-person team, they prefer collaborating and working in close proximity because it supports relatively rapid game development. <cite>Creature in the Well</cite> was developed and delivered within a two-year window, which is rather fast in the game dev world. Listen as Sayre discusses the team’s prototyping practices for <cite>Creature in the Well</cite> in 2017 and how they followed each other to Montreal, where much of the game’s development happened.</p>  

<p>[Video of dev here?]</p> 

<blockquote>So early 2017 we had prototypes or we were like, "let's make a game in Canada." That was basically our idea. We're gonna move to Canada and we're gonna make a game, it's just gonna be the two of us and it's gonna be great. So, we're like, "what are we going to make?" We were in actually living in Dallas at the time. And we decided to basically make three prototypes, and then kind of evaluate them, figure out which ones have the best potential, things like that. So we made three things. One of them was this game, which we at the time the prototype was called <cite>Skip Stickball</cite>. Literally just a cylinder with stick that flicks and then the ball bounces around. There's some prototype videos online, like old GIFs….And then from there we hit the ground running. Adam went straight to Montreal. I spent a little time in Vancouver, with my wife along the way. And then eventually, we both ended up in Montreal and kind of cranked through production. The core production was 12 months basically and then we spend a lot of time just fixing bugs and porting and shipping in 2018.”</blockquote>

<p>Here’s Volker speaking about Montreal.</p> 
<blockquote>52: Yeah, from AAA to the indie, the scene has been very welcoming. It's got a couple organizations in town that host events that everybody goes to you see the same faces and everyone's really, really friendly. The French language part is a hurdle for us as Americans, such as learning the language and integrating in that. The food is super awesome. The weather is fun because it makes you feel like you're traveling without traveling. The city changes, so much between the winter and the summer.</blockquote>  #soundcite

<p>At the time of speaking with Volker and Sayre, the pandemic hadn't yet shut down everything in Montreal and beyond. They were drawn to the buzz of Montreal and its creative community. Montreal is a hub for independent and AAA game studios and major internet companies such as Rockstar, Google and Amazon. In fact, reports have estimated that it has more than 200 game and creative studios (and that number is likely changing as I write this chapter). One landmark for game development is the MEGAMIGS convention, an industry-focused convention for gaming industry held every fall in Montreal that features a large hall for game playthroughs and speaker panels about myriad topics. Panels for the 2021 edition in November included “Dead Good PR” and “Programmers are from Mars, designers are from Venus: understanding interdisciplinary communication.” Like 2020, it was an entirely virtual conference, mediated through screens and webcams.</p>  

<p>I tell Volker and Sayre’s story here because they were the last creators I spoke with before the pandemic prompted the official cancellation of the 2020 MEGAMIGS as well as the seminal Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The warning signs had been there, as companies such as Sony and Facebook were backing out of GDC, citing the health and safety of its employees. Volker and Sayre also had reservations as news of the virus was spreading. I hadn’t yet cancelled my plans. Here’s Volker in February 2020: “I’m super bummed that even if we do end up going this year, a lot of the events and a lot of people that we were going to see won't be there. So if you're going for the first time, don't judge the conference.” #soundcite   </p> 

<p>I couldn’t judge the conference because I couldn’t go. On February 28, 2020, the organizers of GDC announced that the in-person conference would be postponed but a free conference would take place on Twitch. That meant hundreds of game developers would miss those crucial in-person connections with potential collaborators, playtesting sessions with audiences, and events and parties that often lead to publisher support and funding. Instead, GDC would stream a number of panels and talks on Twitch, and later announce plans for GDC Summer, another virtual event that took place as the pandemic ravaged the world.</p> 

<p>It should be no surprise that events such as MEGAMIGS and GDC were relegated to Twitch, Zoom rooms and Discord channels once the pandemic hit many of us like the final boss in <cite>Creature in the Well</cite> Those lively panels and meetups at bars and co-ops? Gone? Proximal collaboration? Gone. It’s a wonder how many games in progress, and collaborations that might have been, were outright cancelled in response to virtual conferences.</p>  

<p>Feelings about collaborative losses were swirling between me and David Martin, a Quebec native and another game developer who lives in Montreal. Martin is a developer with the small indie-team Barnaque, which released the experimental puzzle game <cite>Infini in 2020</cite>. Mixing abstract art with esoteric dialogue and atmospheric music, the game was nominated or won awards at festivals such as Tokyo Game Show 2020 and Independent Games Festival at the Game Developers Conference. Martin wrote most of the music with his collaborator Marc-André Provencher, leaving much of the programming to his main collaborator, Émeric Morin. Listen as he describes how roles and tasks cross between the team, which is typical in independent game development collaborations.</p>   

<blockquote>Émeric does most of the programming, I do a lot of programming too, but he does the deeper stuff. I do the music would help and the art and for everything else. He does most of the level design. I did some of it too, but he did most of it. And for everything else we do it together. In terms of the game design in terms of the story, the narrative, writing was mainly me but he can contribute a lot too. We sort of keep it really open….Like we're not like super protective of each other's roles. #Soundcite </blockquote>

<blockquote>43: We worked mainly in the same room and we have an office. That was pretty cool. Sometimes we would work remotely, of course right now [during the pandemic]. But most of the time we would be in the same room. We would use mainly GIT for the programming and the and the most of the assets also would all be in the same repositories. We would have different clouds, be at Google Drive or something else in which we would have all of our documents, everything so everything's is on the on the cloud. #Soundcite </blockquote>

<p>It’s April 14, 2020 now and I’m speaking with Martin over Zoom. At the time, he and his family have gone for a change of scenery, an escape from lockdown protocols in the city. The day before our interview, Quebec had 13,557 confirmed cases of COVID-19.  During our interview, he narrates the significance of Montreal’s game-development scene.</p>    
<blockquote>DM: There's events that are organized by them and we have all sorts of advantages. In terms of like financing or stuff like that. Not everybody's like super buddy with everybody else but there is this feeling. Like when we started meeting other devs., there was really no feelings of competition or anything like that. People are super helpful. People with bigger studios they give away their numbers, their stats, everything. You really feel like you can ask any question.</blockquote>
<p>Again, the in-person support and collegiality that Martin describes has been almost nonexistent for the past year and a half, at least at the time of writing this book. In response, organizers have tried to replicate collaborative events like La Guilde and Mount Royal for online platforms.</p>     

<p>Stories like Volker and Sayre, Martin and McMaster’s&mdash;and other stories you’ve heard through this book&mdash;run the risk of suggesting that in-person collaboration is so much more effective&mdash;and affective&mdash;than remote work. Rather, my aim has been to bring forth the affective resonances of working together in shared time and space. These stories have a kind of biased toward positivity, in part because the games have been completed. In-person collaboration doesn’t work for everyone, of course, and to suggest otherwise runs the risk of reifying ableist and gendered concerns that scholars such as Aphra Kerr ( 2021) and Alayna Cole and Jessica Zammit ( 2021) have raised about studying game jams.</p>     

<p>That said, an interesting case of someone who values and speaks in great detail about collaboration in both contexts is Hannah Nicklin.</p>      

<p>In June 2020, Jessica Oliveira Da Silva and I join a Skype call with Nicklin, who is the CEO and lead narrative designer for the company Die Gute Fabrik, based in Copenhagen. In 2017, Nicklin was brought it to write the narrative for the company’s game <cite>Mutazione</cite>, about a teenage mutant who returns home to take care of an elderly family member (double check). At first, Nicklin would work remotely from London but travel to Copenhagen for redesign meetings. “I would go in and spend the time in the meeting room. We would do a lot of the design discussion in those times,” she tells us. The exigency for those visits centred on embodied collaboration.  Listen as they discuss two points relative to this chapter: the challenges of remote collaboration, but the necessity to work independently because in-person collaboration is too distracting. She begins by talking about Christoffer Holmgård, a game designer and one of the founders of Die Gute Fabrik.</p>

<blockquote>Nicklin: One thing that I wish Christoffer tried to implement, but just people in the office were really resistant to, was that collaboration over calls is much better when everyone is on the same terms. So whenever one goes to a room with their headphones on and talks in the same way, as someone who is remote is experiencing, you put everyone on the same level of communication. Whereas if there were three people in the office talking to two remote people, the people in office have extra cues; they have asides; they have body language.</blockquote> 

<p>I’m going to continue Nicklin’s story in part four of this chapter, which speaks further to stories of the affective value of remote collaboration.  For now, I want to end this section of Chapter Two by once again acknowledging that remote collaboration is well-founded in writing studies and game development. Though Volker and Sayre are seemingly inseparable as proximal collaborators, for example, they collaborated remotely with teams who “ported” <cite>Creature in the Well</cite>to game consoles such as Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Here is Sayre  speaking about how porting worked.</p>

<blockquote> Rich Shivener  43:54
Now, did you handle the ports? I was speaking with one developer who said their game was outsourced. How did that work on your end?<br>

Sayre   44:17
It's kind of impractical for us as a small team to be simultaneously testing it and putting it on all of the consoles. We just develop on PC, basically. But in the past we've done our own porting. We made some games work on PS4 and its own thing. You just have to do a lot of optimization and a lot of bug fixing. The engines take care of a lot of it. Using Unreal and Unity really makes it pretty much a one-click build-to-platform but it doesn't fix all the optimization issues in your assets and all the creative decisions you made. But we used a team for this. We just needed to release more platforms than we could do it one, so we had a team that helped us do Switch and Xbox at the same time. Okay. And then we followed up later to do PS4.</blockquote> 

<p>Beyond Volker and Sayre’s outsourcing of porting to remote teams, several developers I spoke with noted that their small teams are entirely remote and dispersed across several countries and timezones. I tell their stories in the next section.</p>
