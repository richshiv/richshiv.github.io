  <p>Now playing: "Chapter 2"<br>____</p>
</div>

<p>Hi there, this is Rich Shivener, and you’re listening to the opening of Chapter Two of <em>Feeling Digital Media.</em> This chapter is titled “Feeling Feedback: Stories of Live-Streaming and Starting 100 Days of Writing.”</p>
                                
<blockquote>Rich Shivener: I don't know why … I'm so terrified of doing live streaming. And maybe it's because I'm not doing game development. But I felt like if I composed one of one of my own digital projects, like a web-design build or a digital argument, and live streamed it … I don't know. It just really frightens me. What do you think about that?</blockquote>
                                
<blockquote>Patrick Traynor: You're very much not alone of being scared of it. It’s very understandable. And a lot of people feel that way. I personally worked my way up. I started with just the mic and the webcam. I had hobbyist games and then I worked my way up. It's also tough.</blockquote>

<p>Feedback––it’s a love-hate practice of writing and publishing. In the previous chapter, we heard from a number of scholars that feedback is one of the most painful practices related to scholarly webtexts. It comes in multiple waves, it’s lengthy, it’s ripe with comments of praise, confusion, and otherwise constructive criticism and usually from more than two reviewers. Moreover, feedback comes after an initial submission, later flowing back to coding, design editing, and more. Not everyone reading or listening to this will agree that revising a webtext is more affective and time-intensive than an alphabetic article. Still, many of us who publish have experienced similar pains related to feedback, especially if we’ve sunk a considerable amount of time and energy into an article or book project and are expected to wait several weeks or months for a letter from an editor along with reviewer comments.</p> 

<p>So if practices of feedback and revision are painful, what might we do in the field of writing studies to perhaps lessen that pain––or come at it and process it differently?</p> 

<p>In Chapter Two, I turn to stories of creators who compose digital media in real-time with remote communities on Twitch. When I was preparing this book in 2020 and 2021, we were––and perhaps still are––in the thick of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. The coronavirus relegated many of us to our homes, forcing us into isolation and behind computer screens more often than we probably would have liked. (And as someone who revels in in-person fieldwork, this was really challenging for my research. More on that in the “Ephemera” section of this chapter.) For disciplines such as writing studies, we were forced to work remotely, whether on research, teaching, or digital media production. We were pressed, that is, to present our work, our voices, and our bodies to remote communities in engaging ways.</p>  

<p>Combined with my research concerning how scholarly creators handled feedback, the pandemic created exigencies for turning to creators who live-stream their content creation. By live-streaming, I mean the practices of composing in real-time and engaging with public audiences on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. These practices are vulnerable acts for creators, potential subjected to harassment and spam (see, for example, London et. al’s discussions of women content creators). However, live-streaming practices establish more public, real-time communities of feedback. Scholars engaging in such practices might help increase the visibility of their work, cultivate affective encounters in real-time, and enrich their projects from its early stages to its final delivery. Such practices might be productive counter-acts to the long tail of academic publishing. As noted in Chapter One by scholars, months of composing digital media and then awaiting peer-reviewed feedback add gravity to feelings of impatience and uncertainty.</p> 

<p>The heart of Chapter Two pulses with stories of creators in game development who stream regularly on Twitch. Game developers such as Justin Amirkhani and Lana Lux have documented their work extensively on Twitch. I turn to their stories and others, discussing their practices and projects extensively and contextualizing them with commentary from a number of creators. As noted earlier in this book, ground-level research into these practitioner stories is a both/and approach to studying practices and feelings. From watching and participating in their live streams of real-time composing, I was able to better address moments in live-streams that were affectively rich for creators, using those moments as talking points for interviews. Interviews, in other words, helped us arrive at a shared understanding of feelings and practices that imbued scenes of live-streaming sessions.</p> 

<p>But before I turn to creator stories, I return to theories of emotion that posit the emergent, transitory nature of affective responses and feelings. Alexandria Peary, Laura Micciche, Zizi Papacharrisi are just a few whose work proves useful for theorizing Twitch as grounds for public, affectively charged feedback practices with audiences. Staying with the present moment, dwelling in economies of feeling, and recognizing the power of affective publics, are worth considering for digital media creators in writing studies. Without considering these practices, writing studies creators are missing opportunities to put their work in public circulation long before the final publication. This chapter details the strategies for taking on such opportunities.</p>  

<p>After working through creator stories, Chapter Two ends with strategies for writing studies scholars who might be interested in live-streaming their digital media projects, as scholarly projects are virtually non-existent on Twitch. (This is not to suggest that scholars are totally absent from Twitch. Many game scholars, in fact, play and hold talks on the platform.) My discussion is based on my own experiences live-streaming for a series titled “100 Days of Writing” under the username and eponymous channel TheeRhetoric. The aim of the series was to integrate my research findings into my own practices, embodying, and thus testing, the practices and feelings expressed by a range of creators.</p>
