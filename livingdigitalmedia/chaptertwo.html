<h3>Feeling Collaboration: Stories of Emplaced and Remote Bodies in 2020</h3>

<p>[Media to be placed; chapter video piece that is five minutes long]</p> 

<p>[Media Transcript]</p> 

<p>As the stories of Chapter One show, collaboration is an area of rhetorical-affective practice that includes circulating tasks between co-creators and mentors, and thus resolving bad feelings, and it encompasses addressing feedback content that circulates between creators and reviewers before publication. Collaboration is a concurrent area practice that accompanies many practices in a production cycle, including revising based on feedback. For creators in writing studies, many webtexts are collaborative at their conception, and some scholars who create webtexts collaborate with horizontal and vertical mentors on revision tasks after receiving feedback. Collaboration isn’t temporally exclusive. It’s a crucial part of living digital media.</p>  

<p>In Chapter Two, then, I dive deeper into theorizing collaboration as a rhetorical-affective practice by foregrounding stories of game developers who collaborate well before a text goes to any reviewer or public audience. To begin, I have some stories to tell.</p>  

<p>It’s a Wednesday evening and Jennifer Scheurle is tired.</p>  

<p>They’re tired of drowning in received and sent messages on Discord and Slack, which seem to produce 10,000 messages a day. Tired of displaying their face on video calls. Tired of trying virtual reality platforms that have, to varying degrees of success, remediated meeting spaces and whiteboards within for a 35-person team. For them, a more interpersonal, physical circulation of ideas would be invigorating.</p>  
<blockquote>Especially as a leader, especially as a designer, a lot of the collaborative aspect comes from being in a room with people, sending on a whiteboard and revving on things together. And I find that so much easier when I'm in a room with people, I find it almost impossible to do virtually. And we tried so many things. We tried virtual whiteboards and whatever programs, and we've tried virtual meeting rooms that have you walk around. We tried VR chat, we tried a million things, but it’s just not the same. And obviously on top of that, the actual social aspect of going for a coffee with someone or having lunch with someone and not only talking about work all the time is different.</blockquote> #soundcite
<p>Elsewhere, Sara Alfageeh is laughing about her internet habits and her company’s commitment to being fully remote forever and always. We’ve met over Skype for a call about her company One More Multiverse, a company developing a platform for creating tabletop role-playing game campaigns.</p>
<blockquote>Alfageeh: There's people on my team, I talk to them every single day and yet, I've never met them face to face. I am a child of the internet in the sense of I've had online friends since I was 15. So it doesn't feel weird to me. But I know that this is very, very unconventional. <br>
Shivener: You don't feel like that aspect is lost. So you're saying your a child of the internet, so you don't feel like you're affected by not seeing those people in a corporal form?<br>
Alfageeh: I wouldn't say I'm not affected. It's just a different way of working. One that I think if I had different expectations, maybe I wouldn't be affected by it. I think also part of it comes from my freelance background, I've always worked from home, it's not weird for me to work from home. It's what I kind of prefer? I like the fact that I can go see like my co-founders and stuff like that every now and again, because we're based in the same city. But would I feel differently? Probably not.</blockquote>  #soundcite

<p>As many of us in academic circles have come to understand, 2020 and 2021 were washes for any kind of in-person professional activities, whether collaborating in coffee shops or meeting and sharing ideas at conferences and week-long institutes. The pandemic indeed impacted when, how and where creators collaborate on projects. Chapter Two builds on the previous chapter by telling stories of emplaced and remote collaboration with teammates as well as public audiences, insofar as online publics are helping creators work out problems and ideas with text, design, code, etc. in real time.</p>

<p>Before I discuss forms of online collaboration, however, I start this chapter by telling stories of creators who have spoken at length about the need for what Poe and Alexander call “proximal composing,” of being near bodies, such as content collaborators in work spaces, to really feel their way through projects––to share immediate feelings of confusion, surprise, and the like. As you’ll hear from creators like Michael McMaster: “It takes a village to make an indie game and it probably takes a village to make an indie studio or to develop a practice in that way.” I complicate such stories with those of creators such as Casey Yano, Hannah Nicklin, Cara Ellison, Beidi Guo, Marina Kittaka, and Melos Han-Tani, who have developed games entirely remotely across two or more countries and continents.</p> 

<p>To address tensions between collaborating in-person and remotely as we return to pre-pandemic working conditions, this chapter later shifts to a proposal for a kind of scholarly jam based on Twitch collaborations and the Toronto Game Jam. I focus on creators such as Douglas Gregory and Attila “Gabriel” Branyiczky  who participated in the Toronto Game Jam, which was online-only in 2020 and 2021. In 2021, the TO Jam saw more than 90 submissions come together across Discord, itch.io, and Twitch, where fellow developers and various hosts played through and commented on submissions.  Theories of embodiment in relation to feelings shed light on such comments about in-person and remote collaboration.</p>   

<p>Lastly, to further emphasize the claims of this chapter and previous ones, I point out, unabashedly, that this chapter is based on research and collaboration with scholars such as Beth Caravella, Nanditha Narayanamoorthy, Jessica Da Silva and Anika Rahman. Horizontal and vertical collaboration ought not to be rendered invisible.</p>
