<h3 id="zooming-in-on-physical-and-digital-bodies-in-motion">Zooming in on Physical and Digital Bodies in Motion</h3>
<p>In the introduction and previous sections of this book, I’ve taken care to draw on a range of theories of emotions that depict the socially dynamic nature of full-feeling bodies and affectively charged practices in relation to collaboration and feedback. This part of Chapter Four returns to and builds on such theories, focusing on rhetorical-affective practices under the area of delivery.</p>
<p>As I note in the Introduction, rhetoric and writing studies’ theories of rhetorical circulation are enriched by related disciplines that study emotions and affects that circulate and physical and digital spaces. Recent scholarship has taken up Jim Ridolfo’s (2012) call to study rhetors engaging with content after its delivery and circulation across the physical-digital world. A work is finished and “out there,” but its wide circulation depends on in-person delivery and through social media. At times, the physical delivery of a text is necessary to ensure better circulation, as David M. Sheridan, Jim Ridolfo and Anthony J. Michel (2012) underscore in their study of Terence Winter’s delivery of films to agencies (#check). John Silvestro (2022) drives such a point further in his analysis of a live event in which National Public Radio reporter Cokie Roberts delivered a speech for a non-profit that concurrently live-“Tweeted” the speech. Before the event, “TWF’s staff and volunteers spent months promoting the event, using word-of-mouth circulation, advertising, and content writing to raise awareness.” This hybrid practice of physical-digital delivery was essential for” a multi-phase [circulation] process through which public events can be developed to generate an exigency through which attendees and members of targeted publics can circulate information” (p. 15). Studies of recent protests drive this point even further by tracing how activists who organize physical protests later engage with positive and negative appropriations of their work in digital spaces. As James Alexander McVey and Heather Suzanne Woods write of anti-racism protests, “Whereas the rapid circulation of #HandsUpDontShoot prompted the formation of anti-racist publics and coordinated material practices of protest against the violence of state racism, #PantsUpDontLoot prompted the formation of racist publics and coordinated material practices of violence against black life” (“Anti-racist Activism and the Transformational Principles of Hashtag Publics”).</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating the symbiotic nature of physical and digital delivery, these examples in rhetoric and writing studies align with John Gallagher’s theory of “update culture,” in which many digital writers find themselves entrenched. As Gallagher defines update culture in the introduction to <cite>Update Culture: The Afterlife of Digital Writing</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
In an age of participatory audiences and audience comments on a “published” piece of writing, digital writers can now see how audience interaction impacts the reception of their texts—in real time and over long periods of time. Seeing and reading this audience reception influence the way digital writers write during the circulation of their texts, which is not possible for print-based writing.
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking with Gallagher about update culture digital writers acknowledge they are “addressing the need to be ‘always on,’ including the pressure of responding to audiences. As the redditor Roboticide and reviewer Margulies both said, ‘I stop when people stop responding’” (p. 73). While Gallagher’s project is outside the scope of digital media scholarship and game development, it’s a useful term for understanding what’s at stake after digital composers across genres and media distribute their work in public. The stories conveyed in <cite>Update Culture</cite> are similar to those we read about from game developers. In its April 7th update, game development company Larian Studios indicates that they are responding to player feedback about its game <cite>Baldur’s Gate 3</cite>. “Thank you for your work reporting issues to us via our socials, forums, support, and more&mdash;your feedback is important to us! Thank you for playing Baldur’s Gate 3” (“Hotfix #23 Now Live!”). It’s a wonder when this project will be completed and Larian will stop responding to audiences, given its massive scale and 45,000-plus reviewers already in circulation.</p>
<p>Game developers and publishers also release downloadable content (DLCs) after the initial release of a game, often charging extra fees to access them. During the production of this book, for example, I was finishing all of From Software’s “Soulsborne” games such as <cite>Dark Souls II</cite> and <cite>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</cite>, both of have “Game of the Year” editions that repackage latter content with the original title. The development team Vagabond team, Justin Amerikani, featured in Chapter Three, publishes updates and new content for <cite>Sometimes Always Monsters</cite> on a regular basis. In an update dated May 2020, the Vagabond Dog team writes about adding new interactions with non-playable characters. The game revolves the lives of authors on a book tour and their personal relationships. “Not a terribly deep feature, but the authors on board the bus will now sometimes work on a puzzle that will complete itself over the course of the tour. There’s a minor thread about a missing piece that needs the player’s help, but it’s a pretty dumb piece of content all-considered. More importantly it sets up a bit of framework that’ll help expand future activities for authors sitting in the table-seats” (“Fans, Fury, &amp; Puzzles - Build Update #447”).</p>
<p>To wit: Even so-called dumb updates are announced by Vagabond Dog, suggesting its transparent and honest with its players. More updates lead to more potential audiences and more visibility on platforms. This is how Justin Amarkani explained updates to me and Jess Da Silva when we spoke with him in May 2020:</p>
<blockquote>I think it's essential in the current ecosystem. Within Steam itself I think we hit the new release shelf. We were on there for like a second. There's an article from Ars Technica, that really breaks down the trajectory of a new release these days and it is shocking the difference from when we shipped in 2014 to today: How many games are shipping, how many games are not succeeding. You have to do everything you can to leverage your position within the marketplace in the ecosystem. I think updates are a huge part of that. It keeps you in the Steam newsfeed. I'll show you here. [Shows screen.] This is my Steam. There's our game; it has a news bulletin, now that is obviously curated based on the games I interact with the most frequently or whatever Steam thinks I want to see. But if you're not here, your game just goes into this mess pile that you're never gonna  look at again. In the store page, once you're off of the new release, or you never hit the top selling anymore because there's triple A's that just like eat that up. The Recently Updated section is pretty crucial.</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere, many developers on the distribution platform Steam release games under the “Early Access” program, meaning they can sell the game as they are completing features, fixing bugs, etc. “Early Access” can be a bit more nuaced and involved than game demos. Larian Studios wrote this explanation of Early Access for its forthcoming game <cite>Baldur’s Gate 3</cite>: “Through releasing <cite>Divinity: Original Sin</cite> and <cite>Divinity: Original Sin 2</cite>, we’ve learned that working directly with our players during development makes our games better. RPGs this large, with so many avenues for player choice and exploration, thrive from feedback as new features and fixes are incrementally added to the game.” The studio has completed and written about more than 20 “hotfix” updates during its Early Access period.</p>
<p>The aforementioned stories of game development implicate how Gallagher defines update culture. For Gallagher, update culture attends to the afterlife of digital writing, a kind of virtual apparition that haunts the writer in question. Making a contrast, I contend that many published digital texts never die. A publication, whether a game or a conversation on a social media about a public event, is still living, growing new arms and legs, we might say, after its initial delivery. Living suggests continual movement and fluidity on which circulation and feelings depend. Living is organic rather than ghostly. Perhaps it’s more or less liquid than gaseous. After all, digital media is often lively when it’s published and it remains that way as it courses through digital platforms, physical spaces (i.e., a convention) and related writings. If digital media is sustained online, then it’s alive. I call this <i>living digital media</i>.</p>
<p>Further mediations on the difference between update culture and living digital media run the risk of straying from topic at hand in this chapter. In short, theories of delivery and circulation, including Gallagher’s theory, and the aforementioned examples are enlivened by interdisciplinary affect theories that emphasize the movement of feelings in public spheres. Affect theory reminds us to even global circulation is interpersonal circulation, still connected to rhetorical bodies.</p>
<p>In social contexts like Twitter, affect, with its intensities, moves us to respond with emotion, which feeds back into such intensities. This is Papacharissi’s line of thinking in <cite>Affective Publics: Sentiment, Technology, and Politics</cite>. As I note in Chapter 3.2, her recent work examines the circulation of affect on Twitter in response to political unrest and interventions. From the Arab Spring to the Occupy movement, Twitter has served as a platform for circulating affect and sticking emotions to textual and visual production, generating what Papacharissi calls “affective publics.” She argues that journalists have resources, a global reach and objective news values, but everyday citizens who compose on Twitter have the freedom to transmit anger, shock, fear, etc. In a sense, through Twitter, citizens who are not tied to news values can transmit sentiments on a global scale, and those sentiments&mdash;or emotions&mdash;continue to intensify when they see response and uptake from publics, whether news reporters or concerned parties. From a global view of top-down circulation that affect public audiences, Papacharissi’s study is important in examining the circulation of feelings and political change that follows. Circulatory feelings parlay into rhetorical action.</p>
<p>Papacharissi’s investigation of affective circulation on Twitter illuminates a theory of feelings brought forth by Melissa Gregg’s “On Friday Night Drinks: Workplace Affects in the Age of the Cubicle.” Gregg hones in on the emotional work of the main character Claire Fisher in the now-defunct show Six Feet Under, as well as a website that features office Post-It Notes. A workplace has social conventions and rules of engagement. As Gregg shows, workplaces that privilege positive affect(s)&mdash;”serve with a smile”&mdash;can run counter to the emotions of workers. Gregg describes Claire’s emotional work that unfolds in a bathroom stall as well as among cubicle-ridden colleagues, positing that we see a breakdown of her “professional cool” demanded by the workplace. Gregg uses the case of Claire to position analyses of online and analog communication that reinforce and circumvent the positivity reinforced by workplaces. Her primary example includes emails and later Post-It Notes remediated on a website. In the genre of email writing, a primary genre of the workplace writ large, “The smiley face (or the signature kiss [x] among women) is a temporary resolution as much as it is an index of the problem of conveying affect through the screen” (p. 254). Elsewhere in the office, anonymous Post-It Notes allow affects to proliferate without “local criticism or other embarrassing displays of affect that face-to-face confrontation might threaten” (p. 258). I should say at this point that I read Gregg’s “affect” as emotion, socially performed and located across the office. Without a doubt, one Post-It note that reads “PELASE [sic] DON’T LET ME CATCH YOU STARVING MY CHILD (UNBORN OR NOT) BY TASTING, EATING, OR STEALING MY FOOD” (p. 258) stems from an emotional center: that of anger.</p>
<p>Beyond <cite>Affective Publics</cite> and <cite>The Affect Theory Reader</cite>, new inquiries into digital affects continue to surface. The 2017 book collection <cite>Networked Affect</cite> offers a range of theories and studies about intensity, sensation, and value&mdash;three key terms that, as the editors claim, encompass affect theory. Susanna Paasonen examines online debates and their affective intensities, while Jennifer Pybus looks to Facebook as an archive of feeling. Jodi Dean offers a promising theory about the movement of affect across online networks and digital media. As Dean argues, “Affective networks express/are the expression of the circulatory movement of drive—the repeated making, uploading, sampling, and decomposition occurring as movement on the Internet doubles itself, becoming itself and its record of trace” (p. 98). In short, scholars in fields that are complementary to writing studies have commited considerable attention to feelings that circulate with digital objects and across networks. These notable studies occasion a stronger focus on the rhetors who help power such affective movements.</p>
<p>In varying respects, the latter affect theories I present here, from Papacharissi to Dean, address writing and those who write in public: The feelings of writers shape, course through, intensify and subside during the production and circulation of public compositions across spaces, whether Twitter or a webpage. Twitter users aim to create change by reporting discontent for political powers; workers try to manage their emotions by moving to spaces (e.g., the bathroom stall, the bar) and leaving notes, which are then reposted on a website for public view. My review of such scholarship, at the very least, further underscores the transitory nature of emotion&mdash;again, socially performed and transmitted across digital spaces. Like Gallagher, I present stories of creators to make such theories more tangible. Living digital media is full of lively creators and their feelings.</p>
