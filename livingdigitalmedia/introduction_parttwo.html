<p>Hi there, this is Rich Shivener, and you’re listening to part two of the introduction chapter of Feeling Digital Media. This part is titled “Affective Terms and Felt Conditions”</p>
<p>This chapter offers a concise overview of current conversations and theories of affect in relation to digital media. As mentioned previously, affect theory has a strong foothold in rhetoric and writing studies. As such, this chapter runs the risk of once again covering the same ground as previous studies (insert citations). However, the format of this book allows for a non-linear experience, so those (well-)versed in affect theory can easily pause and skip this section or stick around for an affectively driven soundscape that mixes several voices and feelings. Like others, this chapter makes use of audio sources and experiments with presenting a theoretical framework.</p> 

<blockquote>Your brain responds to disembodied particles of fear, meaning, you know when you get a kind of bad feeling about a person or a place? …. Which makes me sort of start to picture the world differently, as though there’s this sort of mist of emotions waiting out there that can change you depending on where you happen to step.<br>
                                                               ––Lulu Miller, “Fearless”</blockquote>

<p>When I was writing much of the content for Feeling Digital Media, I often listened to Alix Spigel and Lulu Miller’s NPR podcast Invisibilia. In every episode, reporters tell stories based on months of research about “the invisible forces that shape human behavior—things like ideas, beliefs, assumptions and emotions” (“About ‘Invisibilia’”) From a blind man who rides a bicycle, to a woman who feels the physical pain of others, listeners are invited to feel the forces that imbue everyday life. The show’s approach indeed inspired the format and delivery of this book.</p> 

<p>You know where I’m going with this. Based on conducting a qualitative study over three academic years and writing up practitioner stories and insights, Feeling Digital Media is significant because it makes the invisible visible. The ineffable effable. For this project, I felt those affective forces that shape writing, tools, and authors who enact rhetorical strategies––from invention to delivery and back again.</p> 

<p>Throughout this book, I will reinforce the argument that affective encounters, felt experiences and emotioned discourse are necessary for composing digital media scholarship as well as managing its reception. In other words, I theorize that digital media production is a rich affective endeavour, vibrant with pain and pleasure. Affective work, I argue, is absent but present in discussions of digital media scholarship and across studies of composing processes and rhetorical theories. Yet affective work is critical for meaning-making. By “work,” I mean instances in which affects, feelings and emotions circulate and intensify between composers, objects and other partners involved in a digital media production.</p> 

<p>This chapter sets the stage (meh) for the remainder of the book by unpacking key terms and conditions related to affect and digital media.</p> 

<p>Theorists such as Laura Micciche, Jenny Rice and Joddy Murray have argued that social and rhetorical composing––before, during, and after its circulation––is ripe with affective encounters, felt experiences and emotioned discourse. Thus, this section engages with tenets of emotion and affect theories under the large interdisciplinary banner “affect theory,” paying most attention to theories of affective mobility and circulation. Affect, feeling, and emotion are used interchangeably across disciplines––from political philosophy and psychology, to sociology and rhetoric and composition. In the early stages of my study, my research question took a theoretical cue from Aristotle’s theory of emotions, for which he drew on observations of the body to name emotions and the “states of mind” of people who display emotions such as anger, fear and calmness.</p> 

<p>[Sound bite from….]</p>

<p>However, more recent theories of writing as an affective activity proved useful in a study of digital media composing. Rhetoric and writing studies have paid even greater attention to emotion’s bodily orientations, social movements and circulations. Given its uptake and numerous citations, Micciche and Dale Jacob’s edited collection A Way to Move is a landmark of the more recent affective turn, featuring numerous perspectives on emotions and their consequences for pedagogy and research. Susan Kirtley, for example, re-articulates Greek philosopher Diotima’s theory of eros, or love and movement. “In Diotima’s idea of ascension,” Kirtley offers, “eros begins in our feelings for other bodies and in the feelings and emotions present in our own bodies” (p. 62). She goes on: "For the teacher of composition, eros in teaching and writing, is about embodied, intellectual passion that bridges gaps as a daimon [ancient spirit] might. Teacher-Student. Longing-Possession. Writer-Audience. For many of us the pleasure of writing is the journey it takes us on, and the mystery when it is sent off into the world to reach others.” (p. 65)</p>

<p>Affective movement and circulation are ideas extended in Micciche’s recent articles and her now-widely cited monograph Doing Emotion: Rhetoric, Writing, Teaching. Micciche amplifies prior arguments that rational, logos-centric argumentation and emotioned discourse are not strong and weak, respectively, but are rather productive partners in writing. Untangling such a dichotomy, her writing classroom exercise on “deep embodiment” invites students to speak through the voices, the bodies, of authors in order to understand the writer’s rhetorical styles and emotional dispositions. As Micciche argues, “knowledge cannot be separated from the bodily world of feeling and sensation” (52). Deep embodiment, that is, situates emotion in writing bodies and reinforces the notion that emotion is circulated through writing. Bodily movements––a key site of affect that opens us up to relations and affective states––and oral readings are central to emotional education, she argues. (In a later chapter, I explain that deep embodiment might be a useful method for analyzing digital media productions.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Micciche regards emotion as something performed and not belonging to any body. Drawing from Sara Ahmed and others, Micciche argues that emotions are social, sticky and swirling––especially in composition studies scholarship. In thinking about such emotions as disappointment and fear, Micciche looks to composition studies scholarship that bemoans teaching and labor issues in the discipline; in a way, fear and disappointment become sticky and contagious in the field, creating communal feelings of discontent among teacher-scholars. Micciche’s investigation bonds well with Sara Ahmed’s position that emotions circulate through bodies and social objects, including websites and public messages. Sticky and circulating emotions generate “affective economies” that accumulate and circulate meaning.</p>

<p>The aforementioned theorists have been gripped by relations from which emotions emerge. If emotions are relational, then they are also economical and ecological, tied to people, texts and objects. Jenny Edbauer Rice’s meditations on writing amid human and nonhuman publics further underscores emotion’s relational power. For example, what can graffiti writing do in public? “Before you can possibly get writing enough to respond, it gets you,” Edbauer Rice argues. It is “a cull to writing, which marks a relay between rhetorical context and the affective body,” one open to relations with another body, another object (“Metaphysical Graffiti,” p. 142). For Rice, Lloyd Bitzer’s oft-cited theory of the rhetorical situation could not account for the public consumption and circulation of texts. Examining a text within “rhetorical and affective ecologies” de-centers the rhetor and original text, and calls attention to “ways in which rhetorical productions are inseparable from lived encounters of public life” (“Unframing,” p. 21). Her primary case study of a de-centered, ecological rhetoric concerns the “Keep Austin Weird” slogan that was distributed and circulated in response to the city’s commercial and “big-box” projects. The slogan’s message and affective energy––that of weirdness––flowed through stickers, T-shirts and advertisements. This flow means that “we find ourselves engaging a public rhetoric whose power is not circumscribed or delimited. We encounter rhetoric” (“Unframing,” p. 23). I take Rice’s argument to mean that rhetorical encounters cultivate affects, feelings, and emotions, perhaps forming collective feelings or what Raymond Williams calls “structures of feeling” in communities. In public, rhetoric is alive and dynamic, not contingent on the work of any particular body but rather pulsing through moving, feeling bodies. Bound up with rhetoric, affect is atmospheric, moving from spaces to embodied sensations and back again.  Rickert describes affect and emotion as “background feeling,” using that idea to theorize ambient rhetorics such as Brian Eno’s Windows startup music and Led Zeppelin’s drum tracks in Headley Garage (p. 8). As he writes in Ambient Rhetoric, “affect is in some sense prior to language or symbolicity and that it has a strongly embodied, situated, and emotional trajectory” (147). Put differently, affect, while unseen, depends on movement and precedes emotional expression.[ Audio reference to Rickert?]</p>

<p>Affective ecologies. Embodied sensations. Emotional expression. Notice that, in the above passages, I interchange words rooted in affect, feeling, and emotion. Stemming from a range of disciplines outside of rhetoric and composition, theorists of affect, feelings, and emotions were important for my study because they call even greater attention to an author’s body in relation to objects and fellow bodies that hold, even temporarily, affective values that shape digital media production. Recent theorists also take greater care in defining affect, feeling, and emotion, even as they interchange such words. Their theories are nevertheless important for studying who and what moves people to rhetorical action.</p> 

<p>In terms of bodies and mobility, affect is widely regarded as registers and sensations that transmit and circulate, often unconsciously, through bodies, objects and the like. Melissa Gregg and Greg Seigworth see affect as a force of encounter, but it “need not be especially forceful (although sometimes, as in the psychoanalytic study of trauma, it is)” (p. 3). An encounter might not stop us in our tracks, per se. Still, we can feel something, even if we can’t describe it, put it in words just yet. As Kathleen Stewart offers in Ordinary Affects, affect is much like a charge in a circuit that courses through publics.</p> 
                                
<blockquote>Affect is connected to things. Literally moving things—things that are in motion and that are defined by their capacity to affect and to be affected—they have to be mapped through different, coexisting forms of composition, habituation, and event. They can be “seen,” obtusely, in circuits and failed relays, in jumpy moves and the layered textures of a scene. (p. 4)</blockquote>
                                
<p>Stewart’s theory of affect’s mobility––moments in which bodies and things are affected––accord with Teresa Brennan’s ideas in The Transmission of Affect. Brennan also argues that affect moves through bodies and things and that entities are porous. As Brennan writes, affects “come via an interaction with other people and an environment. But they have a physiological impact. By the transmission of affect, I mean simply that the emotions or affects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these affects entail, can enter into another” (p. 3). Brennan’s remarks conflate affect and emotion rather than distinguish the two. Some scholars argue that affect is social and ineffable yet made effable by feeling and emotion. Affect is amorphous and manifests through one’s object relations and embodied sensations. We sense something’s up, and we respond with feeling and emotion. We move. As Brennan puts it, “feelings are sensations that have found a match in words” (p. 140). Working from Brennan’s ideas, Eric Shouse takes feeling to mean a “sensation that has been checked against previous experiences and labelled. It is personal and biographical because every person has a distinct set of previous sensations from which to draw when interpreting and labelling their feelings” (“Feeling, Emotion, Affect”). Converging the theories of Brennan, Brian Massumi and many others, Shouse goes on to regard emotion as the projection of affect and feeling onto publics and bodies, suggesting that feeling is the in-between element of affect and emotion’s social capacities.</p> 

<p>For several affect theorists, emotions are considered social, too, and are perhaps the most realized because they encompass the body and language, whether through direct words (e.g., fear, anxiety) or metaphors. For example, in The Cultural Politics of Emotion, Ahmed views fear as transitory. “Fear does not reside positively in a particular object or sign. It is this lack of residence that allows fear to slide across signs and between bodies” (p. 64). Emotion––from fear, to happiness, to dissent––is mobile and circulates through bodies, texts and genres, all of which exist in spaces. Ahmed’s “Happy Objects” drives this point further when she discusses positive affect as something an object in circulation accumulates. “The promise of happiness is what sends happiness forth; it is what allows happiness to be out and about. Happy objects are passed around, accumulating positive affective value as social goods” (p. 35). Ahmed’s ideas are quite useful to me as I argue that digital composing teems with encounters––whether stemming from objects or bodies––that accumulate affective value.</p> 

<p>The terms and theorists I discuss throughout this section offer something valuable for Feeling Digital Media, creating a theoretical framework that guides the chapters that follow. Table 2 is a synthesis of their contributions. However amorphous they may be, theories of affect help me recognize that people and things are moved and assembled toward a particular text, an idea. To echo Brennan’s theory, bodies and things cultivate depressing and uplifting energies, and those energies are contagious, atmospheric. Discussions of feeling help me recognize embodied sensations that authors discuss when they talk and write about their composing experiences. “I feel good. I feel constrained, tired, in pain, etc.” suggests that something affective––bodily, mentally––is happening or has happened in a digital media production process. Discussions of emotion, then, put feeling in more direct and recognizable terms such as fear and happiness.</p>
