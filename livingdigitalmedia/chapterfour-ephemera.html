<p><i>Each chapter of <cite>Living Digital Media</cite> includes behind-the-materials that I made or saved while composing this project and the chapter. Journal entries, audio outtakes, snippets of code, conversations—I call these ephemera because they’re materials that are often discarded or abandoned when I move closer to a final publication. Feeling Digital Media’s "Ephemera” sections, however, work against my tendencies to discard project materials over time. Waste not. Some materials were made in anticipation of this section, while others simply surfaced when I was composing. Nevertheless, I hope it’s useful for anyone who does or is interested in this doing digital work.</i></p>                      
                                
<p>Chapter Four and this Ephemera interchapter of Living Digital Media came together in a strange but timely way. I admit that I first I was stuck on the concept of circulation, because I had covered some of the ideas in chapters two and three. However, after attending the Game Developers Conference 2022 in San Francisco, I came back to my desk with new energy for this chapter. A new section emerged, as did new ideas about what circulation means for developers and for creators of digital media. Overall, attending GDC was a space for adding more layers to Chapter Four.</p>

<h3>Testing My Project in Person and Through VR</h3>
<p>One of the joys of attending GDC was playing many games and talking with creators. In a previous section of this chapter, I think through how writing studies might adapt the arcade-like experience of GDC at conferences like Computers and Writing. What I omitted from that section was a discussion of my rudimentary testing of Living Digital Media through in-person conversations and virtual reality, a simulacrum of what we might do as scholars presenting webtexts. The following video is excerpt from a test session in virtual reality, experienced through the headset of my colleague Dr. Beth Caravella. For the main chapter, I omitted this discussion and video because it feels like a model of reviewing that is difficult to replicate en masse at a (virtual) conference. Nevertheless, it is an experiment my colleague and I are conducting and writing about for future publications.</p>

<h3>Highlight Video: Encountering Technical Challenges and Epiphanies</h3>
<p>This final highlight video features some technical challenges that I encountered in the final stages of preparing the book for second review. For example, in late summer 2022, I decided to make each chapter a single page instead of a series of pages organized by section. That decision gave way to coding "Chapter Navigation" bars on such pages. CCDP editor Tim Lockridge was a big help when I ran into some technical challenges with the navigation bars.</p>

<h3>Interview Excerpts with Two Developers: Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker</h3>      
<p>Like Chapter 2’s Ephemera, this chapter closes with an interview with two game developers, Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, the creators behind the game Plinko Burger. In this interview, which has been edited down to five minutes, the game devs discuss the game’s concept to final delivery, including the importance of documentation as a community text.</p>
