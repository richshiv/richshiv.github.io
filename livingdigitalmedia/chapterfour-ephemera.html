<p><i>Each chapter of <cite>Living Digital Media</cite> includes behind-the-materials that I made or saved while composing this project and the chapter. Journal entries, audio outtakes, snippets of code, conversations—I call these ephemera because they’re materials that are often discarded or abandoned when I move closer to a final publication. Living Digital Media’s "Ephemera” sections, however, work against my tendencies to discard project materials over time. Waste not. Some materials were made in anticipation of this section, while others simply surfaced when I was composing. Nevertheless, I hope it’s useful for anyone who does or is interested in this doing digital work.</i></p>                      
                                
<p>Chapter Four and this Ephemera interchapter of <cite>Living Digital Media</cite> came together in a strange but timely way. I admit that I first I was stuck on the concept of circulation, because I had covered some of the ideas in chapters two and three. However, after attending the Game Developers Conference 2022 in San Francisco, I came back to my desk with new energy for this chapter. A new section emerged, as did new ideas about what circulation means for developers and for creators of digital media. Overall, attending GDC was a space for adding more layers to Chapter Four.</p>
<section id="testing" class="section scrollspy">           
<h3>Testing My Project in Person and Through VR</h3>
<p>One of the joys of attending GDC was playing many games and talking with creators. In a previous section of this chapter, I think through how writing studies might adapt the arcade-like experience of GDC at conferences like Computers and Writing. What I omitted from that section was a discussion of my rudimentary testing of <cite>Living Digital Media</cite> through in-person conversations and virtual reality, a simulacrum of what we might do as scholars presenting webtexts. The following video is excerpt from a review session in virtual reality, experienced through my headset as I speak with Dr. Beth Caravella and our research assistant Stefan Blacha on the platform Bigscreen VR. For the main chapter, I omitted this discussion and video because it feels like a model of reviewing that is difficult to replicate en masse at a (virtual) conference. Nevertheless, it is an experiment my colleague and I are conducting and writing about for future publications.</p>

      <p><b>Audio:</b> Show us your stuff, Rich. </p> 
    <p><b>Audio: </b> This is an audio absstract and somebody said to me, "if it's an audio abstract, I immediately think it needs to be an audio file and not something like this, because my expectation is that it will be a video. What I'm doing now is converting these into videos, just short clips. Was that your impression, Beth, when you looked at it? You expected a video?</p> 
       <p><b>Audio: </b> I liked this more than just having a regular ... small audio gray box. I liked this because it showed the waves, the actual voice. But I would say that if you were going to keep it this way, I would rather it be just the small rectangle around the waves and voice lines itself. If it is taking up the video space, I would want if not a full video then some movement, whether you're having things fade in and out or making it small so that it's just the audio waves. </p>

<h3>Highlight Video: Encountering Technical Challenges and Epiphanies</h3>
<p>This final highlight video features some technical challenges that I encountered in the final stages of preparing the book for second review. For example, in late summer 2022, I decided to make each chapter a single page instead of a series of pages organized by section. That decision gave way to coding "Chapter Navigation" bars on such pages. CCDP editor Tim Lockridge was a big help when I ran into some technical challenges with the navigation bars.</p>

<h3>Interview Excerpts with Two Developers: Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker</h3>      
<p>Like Chapter 2’s Ephemera, this chapter closes with an interview with two game developers, Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, the creators behind the game Plinko Burger. In this interview, which has been edited down to five minutes, the game devs discuss the game’s concept to final delivery, including the importance of documentation as a community text.</p>

<p><b>Zayna Sheikh:</b> I think our strategy going in was to have a little bit of stuff to make our space feel connected to the game and exciting to wonder what's up with the picnic table over there and contribute to this overall theatrical performance aspect of showcasing. So, we can thank David for the awesome aprons, and we ended up custom laser cutting stamps to stamp the hats, the diner hats that we had, and we went as high on production value with as low a budget as we had to make stuff, which was really fun. So, I think buying in to the bit, buying into the fast-food side of this experience and what the game is kind of bringing to its players and experience of being there was important for us, because not only does it make you stand out a little bit more, but it also is much more fun and whimsical as a player to be like, "Oh, there's lots going on here," and I think the receipt printer and the outfits and everything really contributed to people's positive experience with the game, separate of actually even playing the game.</p>

<p><b>Rich Shivener:</b>
So, what kind of parts did you divide and conquer, because this seems like such an amazing collaboration. Cause I was looking around but I'm also just such a noob at this stuff. I'm very interested in it, but who did what basically, if you had to break it down that way, to get this all done in a short amount of time?</p>

<p><b>David Vicker:</b>
I'd say Zayna was the brains and the brawn behind this. She was really the driving force. I was there as the support guy. I'd do whatever she needed me to do, whether that was making the bottles or coming up with basically the menu, all the different burger items that we were going to have, and some random stuff like that, but Zayna was definitely...</p>

<p><b>Zayna Sheikh:</b>
[You did all] the audio in the game.</p>


<p><b>David Vicker:</b>
Oh yeah. I forgot about that. I did the audio recordings.</p>


<p><b>Zayna Sheikh:</b>
Are you forgetting all of your major contributions, David?</p>

<p><b>David Vicker:</b>
I know, but it's just cause I'm so impressed by what she was able to do because it was just way out of my realm. I hadn't done much like it, so every time that I'm playing the game, I'm always paying attention to, wow, I can't believe she got this to work and this to work and I kind of forget what I did, but I did do the audio. So, we have people pulling up to the window, or the fake window, and ordering a couple different burgers, and I recorded a bunch of my friends or just random people in my classes and was like, "Hey, here's the menu. I made a game. Will you guys order some burgers? Pretend you're at a drive through window," and everybody was always like, "What? Yeah, I guess I can do that. What do you want me to say?" And I was like, "I don't know. Just pick whichever burger sounds good and pretend like you're ordering it from McDonald's or something," and that was pretty cool.</p>
