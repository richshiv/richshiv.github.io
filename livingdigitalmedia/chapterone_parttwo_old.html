<h3>Collaboration: Embodied Intensities</h3>                                
								<p>Hi again, it’s Rich Shivener, and you’re listening to Chapter One, Part Two of <em>Feeling Digital Media</em>. This part is titled “Reception Woes.”</p>

<p>According to participants in my study of webtext authors and their compositions, responding to reviewer feedback was a common practice in which negative feelings arose in the rhetorical-affective workflow, compelling the author to flow back into drafting practices, such as writing and coding. Let’s consider how Henry discusses his experience with reviewers of his digital book: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish the positive stuff (about producing a webtext) jumped out but it’s always of course the negative things, the things you didn’t like. (Reviewers) did say nice things too, I swear. But the things that jump out were a sense of disorganization. And a sense that it was too long. And both things, the two things together were really interesting to me. The original version that I turned in had this table of contents that looked kind of like a word cloud where there were these little sub clouds. It was really, really, to me, well-structured, but there was a lot of structure to it. Maybe overly structured. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This moment is indicative of the kind of design and coding work done by webtext authors. During the drafting stage, authors write content, code webpages, design accessible interfaces, and arrange media. Authors write the alphabetic content and serve as the article’s printer and temporary publisher when they host it on a server. In response, reviewers often have much more to say about a draft of a digital media production than an author might see in a feedback letter from a more traditional journal or publishing venue (e.g., Computers and Composition versus Computers and Composition Online). A number of participants spoke about lengthy review letters that cover the various elements of a web project. Consider what Brooke said when she described reviewer feedback on her webtext in contrast to feedback she received on a submission to a community writing journal: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For my community writing piece it was shared and the editor letter said, “This is the overall concern based on reviewer feedback, and here’s my annotated ver- sion of your piece––fix it.” Whereas webtext reviewers discuss design concerns, content concerns, and how they play together. That’s so different to me, because when you’re rewriting the content you have to think about how it’s gonna look on the page . . . especially with a webtext journal that doesn’t necessarily want everything to be linear. <br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of all participants in this study, Brooke perhaps felt the most, in her words, “embroiled” and pained by revision––as indicated by her willingness to speak frankly about her experiences with revision from her initial text to final draft (see Fig. 1). </p>

var modal = document.getElementById("myModal");

// Get the image and insert it inside the modal - use its "alt" text as a caption
var img = document.getElementById("myImg");
var modalImg = document.getElementById("img01");
var captionText = document.getElementById("caption");
img.onclick = function(){
  modal.style.display = "block";
  modalImg.src = this.src;
  captionText.innerHTML = this.alt;
}

// Get the <span> element that closes the modal
var span = document.getElementsByClassName("close")[0];

// When the user clicks on <span> (x), close the modal
span.onclick = function() { 
  modal.style.display = "none";
}
</script>
                                
                                


    
                                

                                                         
                                
<p>The pain of revision was amplified by an embodied moment during a social gathering with peers in her graduate program. One advanced graduate student, also an editor for an online journal, told Brooke that he knew the status of her revised webtext before she learned of it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somebody asked me, “Hey, have you heard about your (webtext)?” And I said, “No, I haven’t.” And then this guy, (the editor), had to be “Mister Guy” (and) was like, “Oh, I know what’s going on with it,” and told me things that I probably shouldn’t have known, and then later I got the feedback and so I already knew it was going to not be accepted again, and I also had this weird, like, orientation of well, “This person didn’t like it and thought we shouldn’t publish it.” It made me take the feedback a lot harder. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Mister Guy” wasn’t doing Brooke any favors, but he was giving her a reason to physically stop composing her webtext. He didn’t help her move forward. Brooke isn’t alone in harbouring negative feelings over the course of several rounds of reviewer feedback that moved her project back to drafting––four time periods in which she rewrote, recoded, redesigned, and edited her webtext. <br/></p>

<p>In Lane’s case, his vision for a digital monograph took a totally different turn when reviewers told him that “it looks like a slideshow.” In Henry’s case, reviewers “hated” what they called his “expressive table of contents.” Furthermore, in an interview at the DMAC Institute, two scholars, Ian and Nick, who collaborated on a recent webtext, spoke of their surprise to see 14 pages of single-spaced feedback from the review board, five members of which wrote critiques. This webtext went through two “tiers” of review, during which all board members of the journal could provide feedback. Here is an example from the opening pages of their feedback letter: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier reviewers at the Tier 1 level did indicate that they found your webtext fairly text-heavy. At the Tier 2 (Editorial Board) level, readers seemed to focus more on the content than the design, but did have some suggestions for tweaks to the design to make the webtext more user-friendly throughout. </p>

<p>For example, one reviewer suggested “you might consider enabling users to adjust the size of the graphs to adapt to their display. (Mobile display looks great in both iOS and Android.)” </p>

<p>Also, regarding your photos, you will need to provide ALT text, captions, and APA-style citations on your references list for these images. . . . A reviewer also suggested, “It would also be nice if one could access a higher resolution im- age by clicking on the thumbnails.” <br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above passages are intriguing because they shows that reviewers want something less “text-heavy” and more reflective of an interactive webpage with multimedia elements. However, text-heaviness is something many participants have significant training within print contexts; the multimedia elements, such as interactive graphs and high-resolution images cropped in Photoshop, are products of their independent learning and tinkering. And that learning has its own set of frustrations, according to several participants. Consider what Ian told me at DMAC when he discussed his experience learning the programming language Javascript, a programming language that runs underneath interactive graphs and many websites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember three eight-hour days of<em> just banging my head against the wall</em>, trying to get like a dot on top of a line. It wasn’t even my graph; I was just trying to make any graph to get the syntax, and I was like, ‘This is never going to happen’” (emphasis added). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ian and Nick spent weeks writing content and tinkering with the technical requirements of the webtext, and reviewers sent back requests that would require more time. Ian’s technical challenges and the reviewer feedback on his co-authored article indicate that negative feelings––such as banging one’s head against the wall––flow between drafting and reception practices, such as when responding to reviewer comments. Thus, the next section of this chapter dwells on the drafting stage and discusses the aftermath of negatively charged practices, such as designing and coding during the drafting stage.<br/></p>

<p>I should mention some authors who reflected on some positive outcomes of reception. Grace, for example, said she was grateful for the feedback from two peers who were reviewed her webtext:<br/></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really agreed with all the things that they said about it, and that’s not always the case. Sometimes you get feedback back from editors and you’re like, “Oh god, I don’t want to change that or do that thing that you’re suggesting.” It was kind of fun to go through and, like, take a machete to it. We changed a lot and they may very well ask us to make more changes too, but to see the growth has been really cool. (emphasis added)<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grace’s commentary on the reception stage raises another subtheme among participants: time. Not one person described reviewers and editors as intending to be evil, malevolent, or in any way negative. For Brooke and Ian and Nick and many others not mentioned here, a common message was that lengthy feedback can be time-consuming and thus overwhelming, even if it’s intended to be formative for junior scholars. The time needed to engage with the feedback and revise a webtext can be considerably more than that for a print article.</p>
