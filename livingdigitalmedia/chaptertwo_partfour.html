<h3>Remote Collaboration’s Affective Promise</h3>

<p>The previous section of Chapter Two ends with a lingering yet important acknowledgement that remote collaboration is a vital, affectively rich practice for creators in both scholarly and game development realms. And frankly, we’ve had to make remote collaboration work, whether we like it or not. This section emphasizes that last point by telling stories of creators such as Hannah Nicklin, Casey Yano, and Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka.</p>

<p>First, let’s resume Nicklin’s story from the previous section. Remember that she moved from London to Copenhagen to help write and redesign the narrative for the mutant island game <cite>Mutazione</cite>, developed by indie development company Die Gute Fabrik. Nicklin’s work ethic and creativity eventually landed her the role of studio lead and CEO of the company. During our Skype call in June 2020, she shares a number of design documents and programs that held <cite>Mutazione</cite> together. We review a spreadsheet called “Narrative Sheets” that include locations, plot lines and shorthand notations about where to find the narrative scene in the code. Later, she is displays documents called “redrafts,” and documents in the Unity game engine called “plot line manager” and “Storybeats.” The “Truth Sheet” is one critical document that connects others.  As the following video demonstrates, she describes it as we look at a screen full of text that contains in-game passages such as “Tung said people hang out in the bar,” and locations such as “Harbour” and “Town Square.”</p> 

<p>[Video with screenshots and such to support the quote.]</p>
<blockquote>Nicklin 32 mins: So this is a record of every single conversation that exists in the game. Something that when I arrived … that was just the story tool. So the story tool is this. Currently, you can search by name. That was a feature that I fought quite hard for. Before that it was just a list. It was just a list of every conversation in the game. So I quickly encouraged us to maintain what we called the Truth Sheet [a Google Sheet I built myself to help us keep track of the writing in the game], that included more information. So what it is called is the label; that's how you find it in the story edits tool, which is a standalone program built in unity, which connects to unity. The label is the name that you would find it by in the story editor tool. The plotline is how it's implemented, I'll talk about more that in a second, but that also helps you find it within unity as opposed to industry at a tool. Then after we'd sort of done the redesign around how time worked in the game; there are 52 or 53, I can't remember how many exactly absolute times in the game. So as you play the game, you get a day and then you get a time of day, right? You get Monday lunchtime. But the very first time of the day is zero. And let's say the first day is Monday, dawn, Monday, lunchtime would be absolute time two. Monday afternoon would be absolute time three, for example. And then I also have a day filter because when I was redrafting, it was useful to go through on a date, like a day to day basis. You could also filter by what characters are in there. Then in a more complicated way, where they happen and what activity they use. Activity is the basic arrangement of characters and that default animations. </blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it’s needless to say that an overwhelming amount of visual-textual documents held this game together. Admittedly, I tell Nicklin that I’m even more intimidated about working as a writer in video games because it requires much coordination. But I’m also convinced that Nicklin loves serving in her hybrid capacity of studio lead and narrative designer. Nicklin embraces the tension of collaborating with programmers, treating negotiation and any associated bad feelings not as a personal slight but rather a part of the collaborative development process. Her comment that follows casts a positive light on the way Casey O’Donnell depicted tensions between designers and programmers.</p> 
<blockquote>HN 53: I really, really want to say that when I'm talking about the programmers not having done this or not having done that, that is a systems tension, and a production tension, which just exists no matter what. The people I worked with were brilliant. And part of being a narrative designer is having to argue and fight for the story in the room. That is part of the job and equally a programmer's job is to fight for what they see to be their priorities. That's why you need excellent producers. That's why you need excellent creative leads to assess actually what should win out in this case. If there is a way to free up resources in order to support this thing, which we hadn't anticipated. Yes, in an ideal world, everyone is in on a project from the beginning. But also practically, you can't fund projects like that. Very often they have to start out from a place where there's just one or two people working on them. In games, often that isn't the storyteller. I just want to say that it's systemic and not personal. I worked with excellent programmers. It's just the result of game design.</blockquote>
<p>For Nicklin, this distributed, highly collaborative game development can, and has been, working remotely in an effective way, more often than not. Echoes of her sentiments come through in my conversation with Cara Ellison, writer and narrative designer for the game <cite>Void Bastards</cite>, the development company Blue Manchu’s sci-fi first person shooter about the prisoners and space pirates hijacking luxury and cargo ships to escape what seems like an infinite death cycle. Like Nicklin, Ellison was brought in after assets and mechanics for the game had been developed by Blue Manchu. And like Nicklin, the team’s affective orientation toward collaborating with her was positive. A mix of writing programs and spreadsheets helped her plot text, main character dialogues, and “barks,” those lines of dialogue spoken by non-playable characters in the game. She worked entirely remotely, as she explains when we meet over Skype in April 2020. Her main collaborator was Ben Lee, the art director of <cite>Void Bastards</cite>. The two had co-crafted the comic book-style of the art and the extremely sarcastic tone of the game. Listen as Ellison speaks of the game’s collaborative development as it crossed time zones and geographies.</p>

<blockquote>Cara Ellison: At the time Ben was living in Brighton in England. Jon was living in Canberra [Australia] with the rest of the team. I was living in Edinburgh in Scotland, so it was done remotely. It was actually easier to talk to Ben that way because he was on UK time.<br>
Rich Shivener  09:20: It's really fascinating how a lot of independent game development is distributed so much [remotely, across the world].<br>
Cara Ellison  09:40: The more specialist you get, I think the more you have to work in the same building, because with smaller games, you can actually you're generally jack of all trades. I think if you're going to succeed, especially as a narrative designer of independent games, you can't just be a writer. You have to be a designer, scripter, you have to understand the player experience. You have to have a fundamental understanding of user experience. What's the first hour like? Are you playing through the game? How can you sculpt the player's understanding of information via like what you're writing and giving them? Usually you have to have some kind of fundamental understanding of the containers that your text might sit in if the player sees them and how many different mechanics you might have to name or what items you might give them. So you have to kind of be more of a designer, I would say in Independent Games as a narrative designer, then you would in a very, very large studio that is making like <cite>God of War</cite>&mdash;because there you can be like a pure class writer and then have a spreadsheet where you like write the barks and then you write the script and it's all very A to B. Obviously in that role you still need to know games very well but you can actually be more of a pure writer, although that all that is thrown out of the water in my current job. I'm working in an RPG [role-playing game], and RPGs are very demanding across all levels of design. So you can't just be a writer for an RPG. You have to be everything.</blockquote> #soundcite

<p>Ellison’s comment reminds me why this project has focused on relatively small, independent teams that share and blend roles during a production. These teams parallel the work of collaborators of digital media scholarship. (See, for example, the Chapter One story of Eric and Grace co-writing and designing their webtext of <cite>Computers and Composition Online</cite>.) Small-team collaborations, even remotely, is a way of touching and feeling myriad parts of a project in a production cycle. Interpersonal circulation can be intense yet exciting as a project moves to completion.</p> 

<p>To that point, I want to transition now to in-depth stories of small creative teams, especially partners of two and those dispersed in different cities. Again, these collaborative situations reflect the remote collaboration discussed among scholars. For example, rhetoric scholar Sarah Riddick and I spent nine months passing documents back and forth, meeting on Discord to share research updates, then doing our own tasks at our respective desk to Worchester, Mass. and Toronto, Canada. Sarah and I didn’t meet in person until after the article was accepted; our collaboration came together after a chance meeting after a Rhetoric Society of America webinar. And I definitely feel less weird about that entirely remote collaboration after speaking at length with creators such as Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka.</p>  

<p>Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka are the creative team best known for their games <cite>Anodyne</cite> and <cite>Anodyne 2</cite>. Anodyne harks back to 8-bit Nintendo role-playing and dungeon-crawling games like <cite>Zelda</cite> and <cite>Final Fantasy</cite>. Its unique approach is in its soundtrack and plot of subconscious exploration. <cite>Anodyne 2</cite> entangles 2D and 3D dreamscapes to tell a story about youth and identity. As they reference in the official game description of <cite>Anodyne 2</cite>, “Travel the world, meet strange people, and save the world from the dangerous Nano Dust.” <cite>Anodyne 2</cite> was a nominee for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, the highest honour of the 2020 Independent Games Festival held in conjunction with annual Game Developers Conference (“2020”). The team has also released the games <cite>Even the Ocean</cite>  and <cite>All Our Asias</cite>, collectively also about identities, power inequities, and memories. Han-Tani directs much of team’s programming and music, while Kittaka leads writing and art. They call themselves co-designers of their games, much like the developers referenced in this chapter. Han-Tani and Kittaka were introduced by a mutual friend while both were attending different universities in the United States. Here is Han-Tani discussing the team’s initial, somewhat challenging communication practices during their early collaborations.</p> 

<p>[Video of the games and any comments. Maybe about Marina’s comment on the game?]</p>

<blockquote>Han-Tani : A mutual friend. one of my my best friends from high school went to MA’s college, and they met and I asked her if she wanted if she knew anyone who wanted to do pixel art and then she found MA. Very lucky.
<br>
Rich: So you just communicated over Skype, Google Hangouts, and so forth while you're working on it?
<br>
Han-Tani : Email [both laugh]. When I think about Even the Ocean development, I think like one of the biggest mistakes is probably not using a chat app.</blockquote> 

<p>Han-Tani and Kittaka didn’t meet in-person until after <cite>Anodyne</cite> was complete in 2013. When I meet them over Google Hangouts in March 6, 2020, Kittaka is calling in from Minneapolis, while Han-Tani is checking in from Tokyo. (We had planned to meet at GDC 2020, by the way.) It’s about 8pm for me, and 9am for Melos in Tokyo.</p>

<blockquote>Kittaka 16:01  
As far as collaborative stuff, we use Discord, nd then share Google Docs and Google Slides.
<br>
Rich Shivener  16:11  
Okay, from like prototyping to passing art back and forth and so forth?
<br>
Kittaka 16:16  
It's mostly for planning, design ideas, you know, stuff like that.
<br>
Han-Tani  16:23  
The hardest part is pretty much, what are you gonna do in the level? What does it look like? What does it sound like? How does it fit into everything? And that's all just discussion, right? It's just talking back and forth.
<br>
Kittaka:
But we have our kind of, like, processes that we do. Once the discussion is done, we can usually just like do our things. It works more or less [laughs].</blockquote> #soundcite

<p>Han-Tani and Kittaka’s system of collaboration has worked “more or less” for more than three games. No need for in-person meetings and socials. Both developers have not preferred working from home instead office and co-working spaces. Here’s Kittaka talking through a video games cooperative they worked at during the last few months of working on <cite>Anodyne 2</cite>&mdash;that period of time many developers call “crunch.” (See part two of this chapter for Casey O’Donnell description of crunch.) It’s that time when life gets in the way of work, when teams work 10/12/16-hour days in order to finish a game before, say, a launch deadline.</p> 

<blockquote>Kittaka: And during that time, it was very just having to produce a lot of art assets or whatever. And so it was relatively easy to know exactly what I needed to do&mdash;not a lot of really hard sitting and thinking or stuff where if I would want to have a very flexible day. It was more just like, “Okay, I'm just gonna like sit at the computer and hammer out this stuff for a while.” And then it was really helpful for me to have to commute a little because I would really notice that it would get dark outside everyone else would leave. And I'd be like, "okay, if I'm gonna stay keep working, I should have a good reason to, otherwise I should just go home and then like be done for the night." And so having that boundary worked well, specifically for the heavy production time and helps a little bit reduce my crunch-y mindset.</blockquote> #soundcite

<blockquote>Han-Tani: 19:19  
I've never worked at a co-working space. I think it would be fun to have an office space and something but the logistics won't really ever happen. There are co-working spaces in Tokyo, but I don't know, the commute is pretty bad. You've seen the subway videos in like the morning?</blockquote> #soundcite

<p>Han-Tani and Kittaka’s comments are helpful reminders that in-person collaboration need not be vital for game development writ large. In fact, some devs see no need to meet at all because it’s simply disruptive or not worth commuting times, perhaps (see Caravella, Shivener, and Nan, 2023).  Sometimes just being around other people for a limited time can be enough. And depending on the task, proximal collaboration can be harmful to drafting and revision practices. Why change it if the production cycle is moving well as is? I’ll let Han-Tani and Kittaka’s answer that question. “It’s pretty common for small indie games to be done totally online but people haven’t met.” #soundcite </p>

<p>Later in our conversation, I asked Han-Tani and Kittaka if they could see themselves working on a large team, even if it’s entirely remote.</p> 
<blockquote>Han-Tani 33:51: Like part of the reason I'm not really about making games to me. Part of the satisfaction is the development communication process, and how that comes to light. And if that's gone, it's not, it's kind of rote. If I get a job at a bigger studio or something, it would probably be as like a Junior programmer and I would code like a bear. Or like, junior planner, I would like plan the forest level or something. And it would be to a existing set of mechanics, which obey an existing set of financial needs for the company.
<br>
Kittaka 34:35: I think we're both very director-minded, where we'll do the tasks of creating assets and stuff like that. But the interesting part of that is the fact that we have agency and how different things are coming together in an overarching way. I get very antsy very easily. I don't want to just be hyper specialized ever. Because it really doesn't interest me trying to find kind of the laziest way to do each micro task because the network of different things coming together is what's driving me.</blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on our conversation, I’m struck by Marina’s comment on agency. The team’s desire for agency is a desire to feel all the assets and aspects of a game. It reminds me of how Sara Ahmed’s describes “happy objects.” As Ahmed theorizes, “If we arrive at objects with an expectation of how we will be affected by them, then this affects how they affect us, even in the moment they fail to live up to our expectations” (p. 41). To work in isolation on a specific task repeatedly is to limit felt experiences that surface and circulate across tasks. Task-specific roles, in other words, might limit the “economies of feeling” or swirl of objects and feelings that indie devs say is critical to their work.</p>

<p>Similar sentiments of agency come through in the words of Casey Yano, who co-developed the game <cite>Slay the Spire</cite> with Anthony Giovannetti. <cite>Slay the Spire</cite> is a rogue-like card game in which your party/character fights their way to the top of a tower by combating a wide range of creatures and beasts.</p> 

<p>[Video covering the game]</p> 
<blockquote>Yano 11: Our processes are actually insane. I think day to day, we really choose what to work on. And then we just kind of tell the other person like, Hey, I'll be working on this thing for like two or three days. And then once that's done, you know, be like, kind of burned out from working on this thing. I'm going to just draw something ... Just like a casual ... we don't work in person. We both live in Washington State. But we don't really meet up that often. We need we need a maybe five to 10 times a year. </blockquote> 
<blockquote>Yano 14: I work in a very different transparent way. And so because I get frustrated transparently if I do I get a bit upset. It details what I'm working on&mdash;because I don't like being asked, what are you working?  And we have a version control. We just kind of highlight what's important. </blockquote>  #soundcite
<p>You can also hear about control and transparency in my conversation with Beidi Guo, the lead illustrator for Lantern Studios, the development team behind <cite>Luna: The Shadow Dust</cite>. I actually can’t describe the game any better than they do in their website description. It’s “a fully hand-animated Point & Click puzzle adventure, brought to life through wordless storytelling, beautiful cinematic, and a breathtaking original soundtrack.” Guo is talking with me on a Skype call from their apartment in London. Guo has team members in Canada, UK, and Shanghai, and everyone touches all parts of the game in some way. Even if the time zones difference make remote meetings difficult to schedule, Guo describes the creative freedom as the most pleasurable part of developing <cite>Luna: The Shadow Dust</cite>.</p> 

<p>[Video covering the game]</p> 
<blockquote>Guo 51: We get to make every single decision, we get to try something very risky that a normal game studio, probably would not try, because a most likely is going to fail. And we can decide what we think is the most valuable thing in this game for us…. I think that's the best part we all contribute in like a level design. We don't have like a level design guy. So everyone designs everything. As long as you have any idea we can all share it and talk about it. We all play games ourselves as well. I think while you play other peoples game you also subconsciously you learned what a good game supposed to be like you can tell a good game from a bad game. So you instantly pick up all those things from the game that you like…</blockquote>   #soundcite
<blockquote>Guo 53: Then we're trying to borrow ideas. I learned so many things about coding and music composing funny enough that usually I will not be that interested. But because we will work together so closely now, when I talked to our music composer, she's telling me what's the reason she compose a piece like this. She really wants my honest opinion, but in order to be able to talk about more detail with her, I have to learn loads of music terms to study some basic music knowledge.</blockquote>#soundcite
<p>It seems a bit ironic, doesn’t it? The idea that the more responsibilities&mdash;or “side work,” Guo calls it&mdash;you are for tasks across a game’s development, the most pleasure you feel. But if stories like Han-Tani’s, Yano’s, and Guo’s are in any way generalizable, the double isolation of working remotely and on one task, or skillset, just isn’t fulfilling, or full of feelings. And so let me fade out this section of Chapter Two by coming back to what Hannah Nicklin said near the end of our conversation. She is speaking about the affective duality of collaboration, that it’s at once painful and pleasurable, a result of working closely with fellow designers and programmers to make the best game possible.</p>  
<blockquote> 1:10:00 Shivener: I had this in the in the questionnaire, but I was curious, what do you think were the most painful and pleasurable parts of working on <cite>Mutazione</cite>? <br>
 Nicklin: Those are same thing. I got great, great pleasure from collaborating with so many people from so many different disciplines, and having so many restrictions on what I was allowed to do with the characters and with the plot and how I had to fight for changes. All of that stuff, pushed me in my practice, in a really good way.  #soundcite </blockquote>
