<h3 id="streaming-and-managing-myriad-feelings">Streaming and Managing Myriad Feelings</h3>
<p>Thus far, this chapter has told stories of content creators who livestream to the benefit of their work. For a wider view of affect in relation to such practices, it’s important to dwell on some of the negative experiences creators discussed. Besides feeling unable to complete a task, game developers opt out of streaming because of the very audiences they invited behind the scenes. Here is a clip from my interview with Gabriel Santos, developer of the game Stone Story, an adventure game animated entirely with ASCII (ass-kee) text encoding, the kind that looks like black and white line art. This happened on the first day of his Twitch channel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gabriel Santos: On the first day, we launched our Twitch channel, I personally kicked two people, in addition to other moderators. So like Twitch, people are a lot more letting loose, you know?<br>
<br>
Rich Shivener: I wonder why that is. Do you have any thoughts on that?<br>
<br>
Gabriel Santos: I think it’s more of the general internet culture that you see can be very toxic in a lot of platforms like YouTube and in Twitch and forums and a lot of randomness, you know, open, open forum-type discussion without accountability. (7:40:)<br>
#soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As London et al. (2019) demonstrate by reporting observations on popular women streamers, one of the biggest challenges of streaming on Twitch is moderation. Santos’ story reinforces this argument. Twitch is still a kind of wild west of digital media production, given that more than 2 million broadcasters are working amid who knows how many public viewers in any given day. It’s no surprise that numerous women and marginalized creators have faced harassment and streams of spam in their chat windows. To build on rather than simply cite the important work of researchers of harassment, this part of Chapter Three relays myriad feelings of creators who livestream. I want to return to Danny Weinbaum. Twitch streamers like Santos and Weinbaum aren’t afraid to kick viewers for toxic commentary in the chat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Danny Weinbaum: Sometimes you get stinkers, which are always kind of memorable. I had one guy insisting that there’s no way that I modeled the assets in the game, and that I must have bought them on the [Unity] store. And I was like, “I don’t know what to tell you, dude.” And then 30 minutes he was just pointing out the discrepancies between the model like, “Oh, this model looks like it’s in a different style. So how would that be possible?” I mean, eventually you just ban the guy, but things like that sometimes are memorable. (11:25) #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a scene of streaming like Weinbaum’s that terrifies me. The messiness of research and writing are on full display. What if someone critiques a line as I’m writing it? What if someone accuses me of plagiarism before I put in citations and such? The uncertainties of the live chat can manifest in real-time, even if I’m not showing my feelings about it.</p>
<p>Some streams have restrictions that seem to temper toxicity. For example, streamers such as Ladee Danger and author Patrick Rothfuss have permitted “follower-only chats,” meaning you can only comment if you follow the channel. President Joe Biden’s 2021 Inauguration Speech live-stream on Twitch was “emote-only,” meaning those in the live chat were limited to emote symbols.</p>
<p>Santos offers that Discord is a better space for moderating comments. Discord is a communication platform that allows users to text, video and voice chat with asynchronous and with real names or pseudonyms. It’s another platform used by game studios and fandom communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gabriel Santos: Discord is better because it keeps a record of what happened. And the culture of the community is very, very different. People are a lot more respectful in this court because it feels more personal and the culture of such goes across servers. So people who come to, to my Discord servers, they’re very respectful generally, you’ll get one out of 200 people you know, one out of 400 maybe even that is problematic and you have to deal with that and we’ve in the core server we’ve only kicked like five people. So far we have something like 4,000 people so everyone’s on their best behavior in in discord….(7:40) #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other cases, creators choose not to stream their content on Twitch because it isn’t conducive to marketing their project. Creators place positive value in rhetorical secrecy,  keeping their affective guards up. As developer Michael McMaster told me about declining to do streaming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael McMaster: I think we feel very lucky that we’re able to make this sort of popular and successful game without our own personalities needing to be too public or anything. We’re four white dudes making a video game. I don’t think people need to see our faces any more than then they’d like, there’s plenty of them already. We’re pretty happy to not be like the kind of very public faces of this company and became just its own thing. (39:49) #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McMaster’s view is understandable. On Twitch and livestreaming services, it all hangs out in public. It’s raw, for better or worse. Rarely are streams edited in real-time. That means things like microphone adjustments, glitches, and viewer commentary come alive in real-time, prompting the streamer to respond accordingly, all the while trying to complete tasks at hand, whether writing or composing music. For example, on a recent stream, Chase Bethea, who goes by Gamercomposer was composing parts of a song while interacting with their live chat. About 20 minutes into the stream, someone called out that they couldn’t hear the music they were composing, to which the streamer replied, “You all were just listening to me talk for 20 minutes?,” laughing about the gaff. In another case, Nathan Wulf, who goes by jitspoe on Twitch, was recording sound effects and musical bits for his upcoming game, Fist of the Forgotten. Jitspoe allows viewers to enter sound effect commands in the live chat, such as commands that generate fart sounds. Several takes failed because the chat continued to enter the fart command.</p>
<p>It was indeed a distraction for a few minutes, but jitspoe completed the task, never getting upset at his audience.</p>
<p>When these issues arise, I’ve noticed that live chat audiences are rather patient with streamers. And they should, for these streams aren’t exactly scripted performances. Live-streaming does call for composure behind the screen, and it also calls for an acceptance, from perhaps both streamers and audiences, that the stream will be imperfect. I would argue that scenes of imperfection and failure are what audiences can learn from most, but I realize these scenes might not be in the best interests of the streamer. After all, advice from professional streamers maintains that viewership depends on engaging content on screen and in the chat, but failure as engagement isn’t a common topic (see Woodcock and Johnson, 2019). Viewed another way, audiences are happy to call out errors, and streamers such as Gamercomposer and jitspoe indeed roll with their failures. As we heard from Patrick Traynor, feedback supports problem-solving. Feedback helps remedy moments of failure, even moments as minor as an unwanted fart sound. Real-time feedback is generative, a kind of affective glue between streamers and audiences.</p>
<p>I want to end this part of Chapter Three with a story of Lana Lux, a solo game developer and long-time streamer of her processes on Twitch. I bring up Lux because she has an incredible amount of experience working through a range of feelings, of dwelling in the negative as much as the positive—and here’s why. Like Justin Amerkani, who we met earlier in this chapter, Lux streams daily. Not just Monday-Friday, but seven days a week for six or more hours at a time.</p>
<p>I said that right—seven days a week for six or more hours at a time.</p>
<p>It’s a humid evening in August 2021 and we’re talking about her latest project, <cite>Strain</cite>, an open-world “survival game that takes place in a city during an apocalypse due to <a href="https://www.lux.games/strain">a pandemic.”</a> She started developing <cite>Strain</cite> in March 2020, just as the pandemic took hold of much of the world, including Toronto.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like survival games that lean more towards finding resources and making sure that all of your basic needs are met. And I think that’s something that became very real for a lot of people during the pandemic, so it really inspired me to make a game that focuses on some of those needs that we have met so easily in day to day life but all it would take is one disaster for us to have to basically spend most of our time maintaining a good balance. So, the game is about that while also maintaining social relationships, which help you along the way and guide you through a storyline that you choose. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When streaming <cite>Strain</cite> and other side projects, Lux displays a range of tasks and feelings to viewers. When we speak in August, she arrives after a productive of week shifting between shading and colouring characters, writing dialogue, and constructing 3D models of buildings and various living spaces. In one stream, a chill-hop soundtrack fills the air while she is designing green trousers on a character model. With more than 300 viewers, the live chat is … lively. As she works on the design, she maintains a conversation with viewers about working as a game developers. It’s like an open-office environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get that comment a lot.  I did like, a pomodoro stream the other day?  So it was a little bit of an adjusted pomodoro. But like, I did 20 minute timers of work. Just to like, try to focus I was actually doing writing. I don’t want to share that part. So did off screen. I just had a timer going let people know what’s going on. And I’m like, okay, tomorrow, I’m doing pomodoro. If you guys have something that you really don’t, you’ve been putting off, you’re having trouble getting to it. Like, let’s tackle it tomorrow. We’ll do it in 20 minute sections, and we’ll kind of do that tough work together. And people were, “Okay, I’m gonna do this. I’m going to do it… I can’t believe it.”The next day, people were like, another one. Another one. I’m getting so much done. And then since then people are like, can you do more pomodoro? I need to get work done. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Video clip of her working with permission from her.]</p>
<p>For Lux, a full workday include working on <cite>Strain</cite> as well as playthroughs and side projects&mdash;and they’re all there for public viewing and feedback. In what I think is a smart business move, she makes her archived streams available to subscribers only, which basically means that her incredibly public work isn’t available to creep-balls and others who have been known to remix and profit from Twitch archives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t really want a lot of attention. Like, ironically, I know, it seems like, “Oh, you’re on camera all the time, you must like attention.” I don’t really like … I just want to build a community. I started this because I didn’t know other game developers in Toronto. And it felt kind of lonely. I was like, “I would love to talk to just one other person who’s interested in making games”….But I really wanted to have like friends who were doing this. And so that’s kind of part of what inspired me to do start streaming. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Streaming so many hours and days comes with affective costs, Lux tells me. She recalls a day of feeling rather stuck on a task, about viewers repeatedly said things to the effect of….</p>
<p>[Take a break audio samples overlapping with the words “take a break.”] #soundcite</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m like, “I can’t just keep taking a break every time there’s a challenge. I’ll never be done. So it can be like a little bit and it kind of like adds to the stress that comes up. So it can be a challenge, but I’m gonna do my best to try to be humorous about it. Because like humor is a great way to get yourself out of your stuckness, your bad negative state, which often makes things worse and worse if you stay in it. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t to suggest that Lux finds her viewers annoying—it’s more that she is OK with displaying and dwelling on a confluence of feelings that surface and accumulate over a work day, even several work days. Many viewers, she explains, still come back and push her forward in her process. Listen as she recalls a stream in which a stressful task parlayed into a enjoyable conversation with viewers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, that happened not too long ago, I was really stressed out with the task. I think I was stuck on a bug. And I was like, I’m sorry, I’m stressed out like please, please like, don’t be offended at all. Don’t please. I don’t even know what I said. Just apologizing I guess. Like, it’s just the bug, I’m just stuck on it, I need to get through it. Because I’ve been stuck on it. #soundcite<br>
<br>
And they were like, we get it, we understand. And like keep going, you’ll get it. And it was like so encouraging. And I was stressed out for a while. And I saw that it was so easy for me to turn around. Because I just had these people hanging out with me. And like, it felt like such a relief. I knew they were all like waiting on me, like cheering me on and like to get it done was like oh, okay, we did it. We can like, have a nice time now. And the rest the stream was just so much more fun and enjoyable and comparison. #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creators such as Lana Lux and Justin Amerkani have demonstrated that live-streaming game development is an affectively rich, time-intensive practice, a practice that can cultivate waves of public, collaborative feedback and displays of feelings within. So for writing studies, is it simply a matter of turning the camera on and seeing what happens?</p>
