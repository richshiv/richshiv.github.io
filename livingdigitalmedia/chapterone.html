<p>For writing studies scholars, webtexts are scholarly digital media arguments rendered through video, webpages, and soundscapes (Ball et al., 2018; Helms, 2017; Hidalgo, 2017; Rhodes &amp;  Alexander, 2015). During the drafting stage, authors write content, code webpages, design accessible interfaces, and arrange media. In other words, authors write the alphabetic and multimodal content and serve as the article’s printer and temporary publisher when they host it on a server. So, what practices and feelings limit and drive digital media scholarship? For this project, I’ve pursuing this line of questioning because research concerning the lived, felt experiences of scholars who produce digital media scholarship remains under-explored in comparison to print-based scholarship. It warrants going behind the scenes with scholars and their production cycles, making visible the practices&mdash;and thus, experiences&mdash;imbued with feelings of disappointment, gratitude, and the like. In other words, behind-the-scenes research uncovers felt experiences that support and forbid digital media scholarship. What happens, for example, when a scholar gets seven reviewer letters and one writes this about their production:</p>

<blockquote> “The ‘sloppy, inexpert design’ really drove me crazy. . . . I was constantly ending up in places I did not know how to get out of and the only solution I could find was to close the [web browser] window and start over.”</blockquote> 

<p>Sloppy. Inexpert. Crazy. These words signal feelings that pulse through the practices in production cycles of webtexts. Similar affective work arises in production cycles that shape print-based articles, conveyed through decades of process research and recent scholarship in the pages of <cite>College English</cite>, namely the journal’s “Scholarly Editing” special issue. Reflecting on a time when personal illness affected her editorial role with <cite>College English</cite>, Melissa Ianetta (2019) revealed “one of the many unseen relationships in editing: that between the body of the editor and the body of a journal” (p. 267). For Kelly Blewett (2019) et al., diverse voices need to be cultivated for our scholarly journals, for “inclusion activism” means evoking “fair and equitable representation, participation, and the desire to learn about what we don’t yet know” (p. 281). And for Lori Ostergaard and Jim Nugent (2019) , public access to journal archives might “bring about more situated and accountable practices for editing our journals and maintaining a record of the often unseen and affective work of our journal editors” (p. 310). The special issue takes a reader closer to the scholarly editorial practices in English Studies, also revealing feelings that imbue practices such as recruiting authors, sending review letters, and archiving materials for future editors and researchers. However, practices and associated feelings discussed in the issue concern print journals (e.g., <cite>Composition Studies</cite>, <cite>WPA: Writing Program Administration</cite>), raising a question about the “unseen and affective work” of authors and editors involved in webtext production workflows.</p> 

<p>This chapter (and the previous published print version of it[1]) makes an important contribution to the conversation that “Scholarly Editing” contributors started: behind-the-scenes stories of scholarly production. Instead of focusing on my own practices as an author or editor, I intervene in this rich conversation by focusing on stories of writing studies scholars who have authored webtexts as digital media scholarship since 2015. As I note in the introduction, my qualitative study examined feedback letters, drafts of texts, and coauthor correspondence, materials that Ostergaard and Nugent might see as “hidden facets of journal editing that can contribute greatly to our understanding of the historical evolution of disciplines” (p. 298). I am answering Jody Shipka’s (2016) call that our field ought to “be attending closely to processes of making” a range of texts” because doing so “helps illuminate the highly distributed, embodied, translingual, and multimodal aspects of all communicative practice, something that is often overlooked or rendered invisible when analyzing final/finished texts, products, or performances” (p. 253). Such facets and aspects are part of the <i>rhetorical-affective practices</i> in circulation throughout a production cycle.</p>  

<p>In the analyses that follow this section, I’ve chosen to present soundbites and production artifacts regarding three areas of practice in a digital media production cycle: collaboration, revision and delivery were the most deeply felt areas of practice, according to participant interviews, and they rippled across other areas of practice. Collaboration with peers and editors often cultivates good feelings that swirl with technical coding and revisions before the final publication. Based on reviewer letters and editorial calls for revision, revision practices entail looking back at the entire project, from design decisions to textual argumentation. Revision, in other words, flow back into drafting practices, often awash in bad feelings. Delivery is a kind of affective synthesis of those conflicting feelings but generally cultivates good feelings between creators and publics. Again, these feelings and practices shift and blend together as they circulate in and beyond a production cycle.</p>  

<p>Before I move to the next section, I have a few words about the scholar-creators whose stories are featured in this chapter. All come from the umbrella field of writing studies, including digital rhetoric, technical communication, and composition. At the time of our interview, Brooke was a PhD candidate in rhetoric and composition at a Midwestern university. Emily, Eric, Helen, Grace, Kris and several others were tenure-track professors in various stages of their early careers, while Andy, Ian, and Nick were tenured. My decision to reach out to authors who published digital media scholarship since 2015 happened to parlay into a good mix of creators and perspectives.</p>  

<p>Even though all of their works are public and they consented to my using their real names, participants could opt for a pseudonym. Creating some distance, this approach is similar to Jean Mason’s study of “hyperwriters” of digital texts. Writing in 2001, Mason’s observations and implications are ripe with emotion in her studies of authors and productions. Consider her results: “Unquestionably,” she notes, “most of my informants&mdash;major and minor&mdash;suffered “techno-angst” of varying degrees at some time or other as they struggled with a technology that made word processing seem like child’s play by comparison” (Mason, 2001, “Implications”). For me, offering similar writers an option to be anonymous is an ethical middleground because it honours the participants' willingness to speak with me about their work and feelings in circulation without recourse––even though their work has already been published.</p>
