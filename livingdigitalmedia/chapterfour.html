<p>[Embedded video]</p>
<p>[Transcript to come]</p>
<p>When the Digital Rhetoric Collaborative published Jason Helms’ digital book, <cite>Rhizcomics</cite>, they held a release party during the 2017 Conference on College Composition and Communication in Portland, Oregon. The party was a scene of affectively rich, interpersonal circulation, animated by Helms’ presentation of the book on (screens) in a live format. A year later, Helms (2018) published a webtext reflecting on the making of <cite>Rhizcomics</cite>, wondering whether readers would leave comments on it after its publication. “In the first few weeks after publication, readers seemed more willing to enter the conversation without having read everything. It remains to be seen whether and how readers will continue to comment” (“Making Rhizcomics”).</p>
<p>In addition to reading a published work of digital media scholarship like <cite>Rhizcomics</cite>, how do you have a chance to engage with it in a shared space (in a comment system or live event) with the author or with public audiences? How often do you read about updates and to it and reflections on after publication? For example, visit <cite>enculturation</cite>’s Intermezzo book series. Anything? How about this very press from which you found this book? How about there? For many of us in writing studies, once we publish a piece––we’re done. There is usually no need for updates, and reflections are optional. Beyond the collaborative practices we heard about in Chapter One, the final delivery has been one of the most pleasurable practices of creating digital media scholarship. By delivery, I mean releasing the final publication for a journal issue or publishing house and sharing the publication on social media as well with peers and administrators. Let’s recall what Alex told me about delivering sections of his digital monograph to a live audience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>….while it was hard and sometimes painful, emotionally evocative, and rich [to compose a multimodal memoir], it was also very pleasurable to see that come together, and to understand that I could write both in a theoretically sophisticated way but also in a personally powerful way. (Alex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s hold those thoughts in the air for a moment and turn to game development. How often do you read about updates to games that you play? What technical bugs have been squashed? What content has been added? How about when you download an application from your phone or tablet’s app store? Do you know what’s been updated? Do you read the development logs and notes? I admit that I rarely read these announcements, but when I do read them, I notice they are often layered with good feelings. A new level. A glitch resolved. More compatibility with modern devices and software. Figure X displays a screenshot of my library page on the game distribution platform Steam, which foregrounds developer updates to games under “What’s New”.</p>

<p>Caption: This is an example page from the author’s Steam library. The top of the page displays updates from the develppers, such as Bigscreen’s Beta’s update that reads: “YouTube is now natively integrated into Bigscreen!” The bottom of the page shows cover images for the games <cite>Griftlands</cite>, <cite>We should talk</cite>, <cite>Type: Rider</cite>, and <cite>Kind Words</cite>.</p>
<p><img src="blob:https://stackedit.io/7a8da00c-15c8-4451-80ef-ab03dc03198f" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 11.26.06.png"></p>
<p>Caption: This image is a screenshot showing a development update from Bigscreen, the development team behind the virtual reality application <cite>Bigscreen Beta</cite>. Two sentences in large font state the following updates to the application: “Over the last couple of months, we’ve worked hard on most of the major Bigscreen systems” and “Now it’s time for a new visual update with a brand new environment: the Bigscreen Classroom!” The bottom of the screenshot displays a YouTube video with the title “NEW Bigscreen VR Classroom environment on Meta Quest 2.”</p>
<p>In this chapter, I focus on another key difference between digital media scholarship and video game development, and that’s the fact that games undergo iterative delivery, particularly as developers present finished games in public and share post-production updates and reflections designed to sustain feelings about a project. Many developers, including some featured in the book, have said that a game is never done. Brad Wardell (2016) writes that “one of the greatest advances in gaming for players and developers is that games are no longer set in stone at release” (“Postmortem: Stardock and Oxide Games’ Ashes of the Singularity”). Even before the initial joy of releasing a game resolves, potential updates reveal themselves. As Gabriel Branyiczky told me in an interview about <cite>Worlds Within Worlds,</cite> “I’m definitely the kind of person who will just keep working on a thing and if I’m given as much time as I like, I will keep iterating to make it better and better and better.” #soundcite This open-ended-ness of game development is something I call <i>living digital media</i>. Recently, John Gallagher (2020) has referred to this practice as writers who ascribe to “update culture,” in which they “[write] comments on their writing, write continuously in response, and contend with emergent audiences at extreme intensity” (p. 6). This practice of living digital media is a pulling together of collaboration and feedback practices I discuss in Chapters 2 and 3. It’s responsive to feelings between creators and public audiences that emerge upon the circulation of a text. Temporally, living digital media is a practice of extending the life of a project beyond the initial production cycle and final publication through rhetorical-affective circulation in the form of updates, presentations, and “post-mortem” writing in public realms. In some ways, these facets of living digital media shape each other. A demonstration at the Game Developers Conference or Computers and Writing prompts new ideas and revelations that are only possible in-person; and the demonstration might prompt an update or a post-mortem reflecting on the entire experience. To be clear, a theory of living digital media still animates the relationship between the creator and digital media. By living digital media, I don’t mean a practice that detaches digital media in such a way from the creator that it takes on a life of its own. This theoretical ground has been covered extensively by scholars such as Bennett, Boyle, Hawk, and Gries. The circulatory nature of living digital media, again through updates, presentations, and post-mortems, means it ought not to be divorced from the rhetor. Put differently, building on Ridolfo’s extensive research into rhetorical delivery and circulation by rhetors, living digital media remains interested in human-computer/digital-tool-audience circulation. Affect theory helps underscore feelings that emerge through circulation.</p>
<p>To shed light on living digital media, Chapter Four begins with theories of circulation, affect and delivery, working closely with recent research by scholars such as the aformentioned Gallagher, Sean Morey, Teresa Brennan, Jim Ridolfo, and Sara Ahmed. Such theories help underscore that digital content creation in circulation is open-ended, porous, and shaped by audiences and developer desires. Shedding light on those theories, part three of Chapter Four turns to stories from the 2022 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an annual event I had been trying to attend for two years amid pandemic restrictions. I look turn to developers such as Yong Zhen Zhou, Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, who have precariously navigated pandemic conditions and exhibited at the conference, working among full-feeling living bodies and not those on screen, then updating their work during and after the conference. Stories from GDC’s expo hall emphasize this idea.</p>
<p>In closing, I once again turn back to the field of writing studies to reframe the practice of living digital media for digital media scholarship. What have and perhaps would post-publication updates look like for an article, say, in <cite>Kairos</cite>? What’s at stake for authors who engage in the practice, either by serializing their work or publishing updates?</p>
