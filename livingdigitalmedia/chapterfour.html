<p>[Video transcript]</p>
<p>When the Digital Rhetoric Collaborative published Jason Helms’ digital book, <cite>Rhizcomics</cite>, they held a release party during the 2017 Conference on College Composition and Communication in Portland, Oregon. The party was a scene of affectively rich, interpersonal circulation, animated by Helms’ presentation of the book on (screens) in a live format. A year later, Helms (2018) published a webtext reflecting on the making of <cite>Rhizcomics</cite>, wondering whether readers would leave comments on it after its publication. "In the first few weeks after publication, readers seemed more willing to enter the conversation without having read everything. It remains to be seen whether and how readers will continue to comment” ("Making Rhizcomics”).</p>
<p>In addition to reading a published work of digital media scholarship like <cite>Rhizcomics</cite>, how do you have a chance to engage with it in a shared space (in a comment system or live event) with the author or with public audiences? How often do you read about updates and to it and reflections on after publication? For example, visit <cite>enculturation</cite>’s Intermezzo book series. Anything? How about this very press from which you found this book? How about there? For many of us in writing studies, once we publish a piece––we’re done. There is usually no need for updates, and reflections are optional. Beyond the collaborative practices we heard about in Chapter One, the final delivery has been one of the most pleasurable practices of creating digital media scholarship. By delivery, I mean releasing the final publication for a journal issue or publishing house and sharing the publication on social media as well with peers and administrators. Let’s recall what Alex told me about delivering sections of his digital monograph to a live audience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>….while it was hard and sometimes painful, emotionally evocative, and rich [to compose a multimodal memoir], it was also very pleasurable to see that come together, and to understand that I could write both in a theoretically sophisticated way but also in a personally powerful way. (Alex)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s hold those thoughts in the air for a moment and turn to game development. How often do you read about updates to games that you play? What technical bugs have been squashed? What content has been added? How about when you download an application from your phone or tablet’s app store? Do you know what’s been updated? Do you read the development logs and notes? I admit that I rarely read these announcements, but when I do read them, I notice they are often layered with good feelings. A new level. A glitch resolved. More compatibility with modern devices and software. Figure X displays a screenshot of my library page on the game distribution platform Steam, which foregrounds developer updates to games under "What’s New”.</p>
<p>ADD IMAGE</p>
<p>Caption: This is an example page from the author’s Steam library. The top of the page displays updates from the develppers, such as Bigscreen’s Beta’s update that reads: "YouTube is now natively integrated into Bigscreen!” The bottom of the page shows cover images for the games <cite>Griftlands</cite>, <cite>We should talk</cite>, <cite>Type: Rider</cite>, and <cite>Kind Words</cite>.</p>
<p>ADD IMAGE</p>
<p>Caption: This image is a screenshot showing a development update from Bigscreen, the development team behind the virtual reality application <cite>Bigscreen Beta</cite>. Two sentences in large font state the following updates to the application: "Over the last couple of months, we’ve worked hard on most of the major Bigscreen systems” and "Now it’s time for a new visual update with a brand new environment: the Bigscreen Classroom!” The bottom of the screenshot displays a YouTube video with the title "NEW Bigscreen VR Classroom environment on Meta Quest 2.”</p>
<p>In this chapter, I focus on another key difference between digital media scholarship and video game development, and that’s the fact that games undergo iterative delivery, particularly as developers present finished games in public and share post-production updates and reflections designed to sustain feelings about a project. Many developers, including some featured in the book, have said that a game is never done. Brad Wardell (2016) writes that "one of the greatest advances in gaming for players and developers is that games are no longer set in stone at release” ("Postmortem: Stardock and Oxide Games’ Ashes of the Singularity”). Even before the initial joy of releasing a game resolves, potential updates reveal themselves. As Gabriel Branyiczky told me in an interview about <cite>Worlds Within Worlds,</cite> "I’m definitely the kind of person who will just keep working on a thing and if I’m given as much time as I like, I will keep iterating to make it better and better and better.” #soundcite This open-ended-ness of game development is something I call <i>living digital media</i>. Recently, John Gallagher (2020) has referred to this practice as writers who ascribe to "update culture,” in which they "[write] comments on their writing, write continuously in response, and contend with emergent audiences at extreme intensity” (p. 6). This practice of living digital media is a pulling together of collaboration and feedback practices I discuss in Chapters 2 and 3. It’s responsive to feelings between creators and public audiences that emerge upon the circulation of a text. Temporally, living digital media is a practice of extending the life of a project beyond the initial production cycle and final publication through rhetorical-affective circulation in the form of updates, presentations, and "post-mortem” writing in public realms. In some ways, these facets of living digital media shape each other. A demonstration at the Game Developers Conference or Computers and Writing prompts new ideas and revelations that are only possible in-person; and the demonstration might prompt an update or a post-mortem reflecting on the entire experience. To be clear, a theory of living digital media still animates the relationship between the creator and digital media. By living digital media, I don’t mean a practice that detaches digital media in such a way from the creator that it takes on a life of its own. This theoretical ground has been covered extensively by scholars such as Bennett, Boyle, Hawk, and Gries. The circulatory nature of living digital media, again through updates, presentations, and post-mortems, means it ought not to be divorced from the rhetor. Put differently, building on Ridolfo’s extensive research into rhetorical delivery and circulation by rhetors, living digital media remains interested in human-computer/digital-tool-audience circulation. Affect theory helps underscore feelings that emerge through circulation.</p>
<p>To shed light on living digital media, Chapter Four begins with theories of circulation, affect and delivery, working closely with recent research by scholars such as the aformentioned Gallagher, Sean Morey, Teresa Brennan, Jim Ridolfo, and Sara Ahmed. Such theories help underscore that digital content creation in circulation is open-ended, porous, and shaped by audiences and developer desires. Shedding light on those theories, part three of Chapter Four turns to stories from the 2022 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, an annual event I had been trying to attend for two years amid pandemic restrictions. I look turn to developers such as Yong Zhen Zhou, Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, who have precariously navigated pandemic conditions and exhibited at the conference, working among full-feeling living bodies and not those on screen, then updating their work during and after the conference. Stories from GDC’s expo hall emphasize this idea.</p>
<p>In closing, I once again turn back to the field of writing studies to reframe the practice of living digital media for digital media scholarship. What have and perhaps would post-publication updates look like for an article, say, in <cite>Kairos</cite>? What’s at stake for authors who engage in the practice, either by serializing their work or publishing updates?</p>

<h3>Zooming in on Physical and Digital Bodies in Motion</h3>
<p>In the introduction and previous sections of this book, I’ve taken care to draw on a range of theories of emotions that depict the socially dynamic nature of full-feeling bodies and affectively charged practices in relation to collaboration and feedback. This part of Chapter Four returns to and builds on such theories, focusing on rhetorical-affective practices under the area of delivery.</p>
<p>As I note in the Introduction, rhetoric and writing studies’ theories of rhetorical circulation are enriched by related disciplines that study emotions and affects that circulate and physical and digital spaces. Recent scholarship has taken up Jim Ridolfo’s (2012) call to study rhetors engaging with content after its delivery and circulation across the physical-digital world. A work is finished and "out there,” but its wide circulation depends on in-person delivery and through social media. At times, the physical delivery of a text is necessary to ensure better circulation, as David M. Sheridan, Jim Ridolfo and Anthony J. Michel (2012) underscore in their study of Terence Winter’s delivery of films to agencies (#check). John Silvestro (2022) drives such a point further in his analysis of a live event in which National Public Radio reporter Cokie Roberts delivered a speech for a non-profit that concurrently live-"Tweeted” the speech. Before the event, "TWF’s staff and volunteers spent months promoting the event, using word-of-mouth circulation, advertising, and content writing to raise awareness.” This hybrid practice of physical-digital delivery was essential for” a multi-phase [circulation] process through which public events can be developed to generate an exigency through which attendees and members of targeted publics can circulate information” (p. 15). Studies of recent protests drive this point even further by tracing how activists who organize physical protests later engage with positive and negative appropriations of their work in digital spaces. As James Alexander McVey and Heather Suzanne Woods write of anti-racism protests, "Whereas the rapid circulation of #HandsUpDontShoot prompted the formation of anti-racist publics and coordinated material practices of protest against the violence of state racism, #PantsUpDontLoot prompted the formation of racist publics and coordinated material practices of violence against black life” ("Anti-racist Activism and the Transformational Principles of Hashtag Publics”).</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating the symbiotic nature of physical and digital delivery, these examples in rhetoric and writing studies align with John Gallagher’s theory of "update culture,” in which many digital writers find themselves entrenched. As Gallagher defines update culture in the introduction to <cite>Update Culture: The Afterlife of Digital Writing</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
In an age of participatory audiences and audience comments on a "published” piece of writing, digital writers can now see how audience interaction impacts the reception of their texts—in real time and over long periods of time. Seeing and reading this audience reception influence the way digital writers write during the circulation of their texts, which is not possible for print-based writing.
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking with Gallagher about update culture digital writers acknowledge they are "addressing the need to be ‘always on,’ including the pressure of responding to audiences. As the redditor Roboticide and reviewer Margulies both said, ‘I stop when people stop responding’” (p. 73). While Gallagher’s project is outside the scope of digital media scholarship and game development, it’s a useful term for understanding what’s at stake after digital composers across genres and media distribute their work in public. The stories conveyed in <cite>Update Culture</cite> are similar to those we read about from game developers. In its April 7th update, game development company Larian Studios indicates that they are responding to player feedback about its game <cite>Baldur’s Gate 3</cite>. "Thank you for your work reporting issues to us via our socials, forums, support, and more&mdash;your feedback is important to us! Thank you for playing Baldur’s Gate 3” ("Hotfix #23 Now Live!”). It’s a wonder when this project will be completed and Larian will stop responding to audiences, given its massive scale and 45,000-plus reviewers already in circulation.</p>
<p>Game developers and publishers also release downloadable content (DLCs) after the initial release of a game, often charging extra fees to access them. During the production of this book, for example, I was finishing all of From Software’s "Soulsborne” games such as <cite>Dark Souls II</cite> and <cite>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</cite>, both of have "Game of the Year” editions that repackage latter content with the original title. The development team Vagabond team, Justin Amerikani, featured in Chapter Three, publishes updates and new content for <cite>Sometimes Always Monsters</cite> on a regular basis. In an update dated May 2020, the Vagabond Dog team writes about adding new interactions with non-playable characters. The game revolves the lives of authors on a book tour and their personal relationships. "Not a terribly deep feature, but the authors on board the bus will now sometimes work on a puzzle that will complete itself over the course of the tour. There’s a minor thread about a missing piece that needs the player’s help, but it’s a pretty dumb piece of content all-considered. More importantly it sets up a bit of framework that’ll help expand future activities for authors sitting in the table-seats” ("Fans, Fury, &amp; Puzzles - Build Update #447”).</p>
<p>To wit: Even so-called dumb updates are announced by Vagabond Dog, suggesting its transparent and honest with its players. More updates lead to more potential audiences and more visibility on platforms. This is how Justin Amarkani explained updates to me and Jess Da Silva when we spoke with him in May 2020:</p>
<blockquote>I think it's essential in the current ecosystem. Within Steam itself I think we hit the new release shelf. We were on there for like a second. There's an article from Ars Technica, that really breaks down the trajectory of a new release these days and it is shocking the difference from when we shipped in 2014 to today: How many games are shipping, how many games are not succeeding. You have to do everything you can to leverage your position within the marketplace in the ecosystem. I think updates are a huge part of that. It keeps you in the Steam newsfeed. I'll show you here. [Shows screen.] This is my Steam. There's our game; it has a news bulletin, now that is obviously curated based on the games I interact with the most frequently or whatever Steam thinks I want to see. But if you're not here, your game just goes into this mess pile that you're never gonna  look at again. In the store page, once you're off of the new release, or you never hit the top selling anymore because there's triple A's that just like eat that up. The Recently Updated section is pretty crucial.</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere, many developers on the distribution platform Steam release games under the "Early Access” program, meaning they can sell the game as they are completing features, fixing bugs, etc. "Early Access” can be a bit more nuaced and involved than game demos. Larian Studios wrote this explanation of Early Access for its forthcoming game <cite>Baldur’s Gate 3</cite>: "Through releasing <cite>Divinity: Original Sin</cite> and <cite>Divinity: Original Sin 2</cite>, we’ve learned that working directly with our players during development makes our games better. RPGs this large, with so many avenues for player choice and exploration, thrive from feedback as new features and fixes are incrementally added to the game.” The studio has completed and written about more than 20 "hotfix” updates during its Early Access period.</p>
<p>The aforementioned stories of game development implicate how Gallagher defines update culture. For Gallagher, update culture attends to the afterlife of digital writing, a kind of virtual apparition that haunts the writer in question. Making a contrast, I contend that many published digital texts never die. A publication, whether a game or a conversation on a social media about a public event, is still living, growing new arms and legs, we might say, after its initial delivery. Living suggests continual movement and fluidity on which circulation and feelings depend. Living is organic rather than ghostly. Perhaps it’s more or less liquid than gaseous. After all, digital media is often lively when it’s published and it remains that way as it courses through digital platforms, physical spaces (i.e., a convention) and related writings. If digital media is sustained online, then it’s alive. I call this <i>living digital media</i>.</p>
<p>Further mediations on the difference between update culture and living digital media run the risk of straying from topic at hand in this chapter. In short, theories of delivery and circulation, including Gallagher’s theory, and the aforementioned examples are enlivened by interdisciplinary affect theories that emphasize the movement of feelings in public spheres. Affect theory reminds us to even global circulation is interpersonal circulation, still connected to rhetorical bodies.</p>
<p>In social contexts like Twitter, affect, with its intensities, moves us to respond with emotion, which feeds back into such intensities. This is Papacharissi’s line of thinking in <cite>Affective Publics: Sentiment, Technology, and Politics</cite>. As I note in Chapter 3.2, her recent work examines the circulation of affect on Twitter in response to political unrest and interventions. From the Arab Spring to the Occupy movement, Twitter has served as a platform for circulating affect and sticking emotions to textual and visual production, generating what Papacharissi calls "affective publics.” She argues that journalists have resources, a global reach and objective news values, but everyday citizens who compose on Twitter have the freedom to transmit anger, shock, fear, etc. In a sense, through Twitter, citizens who are not tied to news values can transmit sentiments on a global scale, and those sentiments&mdash;or emotions&mdash;continue to intensify when they see response and uptake from publics, whether news reporters or concerned parties. From a global view of top-down circulation that affect public audiences, Papacharissi’s study is important in examining the circulation of feelings and political change that follows. Circulatory feelings parlay into rhetorical action.</p>
<p>Papacharissi’s investigation of affective circulation on Twitter illuminates a theory of feelings brought forth by Melissa Gregg’s "On Friday Night Drinks: Workplace Affects in the Age of the Cubicle.” Gregg hones in on the emotional work of the main character Claire Fisher in the now-defunct show Six Feet Under, as well as a website that features office Post-It Notes. A workplace has social conventions and rules of engagement. As Gregg shows, workplaces that privilege positive affect(s)&mdash;”serve with a smile”&mdash;can run counter to the emotions of workers. Gregg describes Claire’s emotional work that unfolds in a bathroom stall as well as among cubicle-ridden colleagues, positing that we see a breakdown of her "professional cool” demanded by the workplace. Gregg uses the case of Claire to position analyses of online and analog communication that reinforce and circumvent the positivity reinforced by workplaces. Her primary example includes emails and later Post-It Notes remediated on a website. In the genre of email writing, a primary genre of the workplace writ large, "The smiley face (or the signature kiss [x] among women) is a temporary resolution as much as it is an index of the problem of conveying affect through the screen” (p. 254). Elsewhere in the office, anonymous Post-It Notes allow affects to proliferate without "local criticism or other embarrassing displays of affect that face-to-face confrontation might threaten” (p. 258). I should say at this point that I read Gregg’s "affect” as emotion, socially performed and located across the office. Without a doubt, one Post-It note that reads "PELASE [sic] DON’T LET ME CATCH YOU STARVING MY CHILD (UNBORN OR NOT) BY TASTING, EATING, OR STEALING MY FOOD” (p. 258) stems from an emotional center: that of anger.</p>
<p>Beyond <cite>Affective Publics</cite> and <cite>The Affect Theory Reader</cite>, new inquiries into digital affects continue to surface. The 2017 book collection <cite>Networked Affect</cite> offers a range of theories and studies about intensity, sensation, and value&mdash;three key terms that, as the editors claim, encompass affect theory. Susanna Paasonen examines online debates and their affective intensities, while Jennifer Pybus looks to Facebook as an archive of feeling. Jodi Dean offers a promising theory about the movement of affect across online networks and digital media. As Dean argues, "Affective networks express/are the expression of the circulatory movement of drive—the repeated making, uploading, sampling, and decomposition occurring as movement on the Internet doubles itself, becoming itself and its record of trace” (p. 98). In short, scholars in fields that are complementary to writing studies have commited considerable attention to feelings that circulate with digital objects and across networks. These notable studies occasion a stronger focus on the rhetors who help power such affective movements.</p>
<p>In varying respects, the latter affect theories I present here, from Papacharissi to Dean, address writing and those who write in public: The feelings of writers shape, course through, intensify and subside during the production and circulation of public compositions across spaces, whether Twitter or a webpage. Twitter users aim to create change by reporting discontent for political powers; workers try to manage their emotions by moving to spaces (e.g., the bathroom stall, the bar) and leaving notes, which are then reposted on a website for public view. My review of such scholarship, at the very least, further underscores the transitory nature of emotion&mdash;again, socially performed and transmitted across digital spaces. Like Gallagher, I present stories of creators to make such theories more tangible. Living digital media is full of lively creators and their feelings.</p>

<h3>Living Digital Media at a Conference</h3>
<p>We might say that 2022 was a watershed year for conferences, as many returned to in-person programming for the first time in two years. In this section, I turn to stories of developers who delivered finished games at the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March 2022. To emphasize the conference’s lively context, I focus on developers such as Zayna Sheikh, David Vicker, and Yong Zhen Zhou, who presented in GDC’s special showcase Alt.Ctrl, which celebrates games with alternative controllers. Their stories occasion a question I entertain at the end of this chapter: What if writing studies scholars presented webtexts in a live format?</p>
<p>Before I tell their stories, some scene setting of GDC is necessary for understanding its lively context.</p>
<p><i>Inside the Game Developers Conference</i></p>
<p>It’s a Wednesday in March 2022 and I’ve just arrived at GDC in San Francisco. GDC is an annual gathering for game developers, publishers and businesses associated with the industry, featuring a weeks’ worth of game demonstrations, panels, and such. (It just so happens that I lost my wallet just after I got off the plane, but that story’s for another day.) The streets are bustling with those who live and work here, but the intersection of Howard and 4th Street is teeming with those wearing conference badges, laptop bags, and video game and technology t-shirts. As I note in early passages of the book, my trip to physical GDC was delayed by two years due to pandemic cancellations. GDC 2020 and 2021 were entirely virtual. To boot, despite wading through what seems like a massive gathering, I’m told in San Francisco that GDC 2022 is scaled down significantly when compared to past GDCs. No giant displays by Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft. No massive after-parties. Small rows of game demos and tables.  But to me, this seems like a manageable introduction to the event. When I attended San Diego Comic Con International for the first time in 2012,  I was overwhelmed by the lights and cacophony of booths and showcases on the convention floor—the allatonceness of the convention. GDC 22 is not like that, but it is still a worthwhile trip.</p>
<p>[GIF or short clip of the outside of the conference.]</p>
<p>GDC’s organization team is on top of pandemic-related protocols for health and safety. Upon arriving, I’m directed three different times to the required entrance to the line for checking in, sharing vaccine passports, etc… The line is long, and rightfully so. It’s the first in-person GDC in two years, feeling like the "annual gathering of video game creators from across the world that in most ways resembled a return to the good old pre-COVID days—save for the masks on everybody’s faces. Well, on almost everybody’s faces” (Grayson and Liao, 2022) I’m masked, but I’m not entirely comfortable—mainly because I haven’t been around large crowds for two years. The idea of mingling, eating, or just being, at an event like this reminds that I’ve kind of forgotten how to interact with 3D people. How to make eye contact. How close to stand, assuming we’re both vaccinated. These social elements aren’t the easiet either in a convention space. With music blasting at a motion capture demonstration booth nearby, for example, I’m having trouble communicating with a developer of a virtual reality system. We occasionally pull our masks down to punctuate the air between us. Again, I’m not entirely comfortable, but I’m grateful to be here.</p>
<p>My research goal for the convention reveals itself when I arrive at the North Hall of the Moscone Center. I pass the GDC Arcade chairs, controllers and screens that offer historically famous games from the convention (e.g., Wolfenstein 3D on Super Nintendo). I pass the third-party vendors selling games, merch, and such. Moments later, I find rows game developers and companies organized by region: Chile, Switzerland, France, Quebec. I play demos of games such as <cite>Legion Hearts</cite> from Switzerland and <cite>Shadow’s Light: Tale of the Champions</cite> from Montreal. Say hello. Take a card. Play. Say hello. Take a card. Play. Thank you. At one point, I’m wearing a VR hearset and learning how to parry and slash in Thirdverse’s forthcoming sword-fighting game <cite>Altair Breaker</cite>. The company had traveled from (#location) to preview the game at GDC. The North Hall of the expo floor keeps attendees like me busy for hours. With controllers and systems ready to go, game developers get rapid public testing with players and consideration for funders and publishers.</p>
<p>This is David Martin speaking about conferencing and live playthroughs in general. His company Barnaque tested their experimental game <cite>Infini</cite> at several conferences before it was finished.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started play tested the game from the beginning because we’ve been going to events a lot. We went to 12 events, I think just with Infini. We would make the demo so in a way that would be some kind of play testing, on the demo we had a seven minute time limit. And after that it would say thanks for playing and we have the newsletter prompt. So what that would do is there would be more people trying the game because like if someone liked the game, and was interrupted after the game, he’ll have the impression that he liked the game and he wants to know more. I didn’t feel cheap cutting it off after that, and people who didn’t like the game, of course, they would just move on. It would allow us to let more people try to play the game. We would show different parts in different events. It would really act as a playtest, because some things would just become super apparent. For example, if everybody would get stuck on this specific level for some reason, then we’d figure out and we’d retry it in another event, and then it would be fixed, we would see it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At GDC 2022, many developers still feel that presenting to live audience is worth it, even if health and safety protocols make interactions somewhat awkward. This is what developers Evan (#check last name) and Andrew (#check last name) tell me as they sit at small table, sharing a physical card game, <cite>Last Call for Alcohol</cite>, and their Discord channel for the game (#check game). <cite>Last Call for Alcohol</cite> is a game in which you pass around cards and attempt to get the lowest values. The player with the highest value drinks. In a way, drinking is punishment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evan: "To me, it’s indescribable, but It’s kind of a feeling of pride and genuine wholehearted happiness. The reason why I create games is because I want to see people enjoying the thing that I create. Being able to see them smile and see the lights in their eyes when they get that design that I’m going for, when they get that ah-ha moment int he core gameplay loop, it kind of feels like adrenaline.” #soundcite<br>
<br>
Andrew: "I prefer face-to-face. I get a lot of energy while I’m descriving my game to people. Seeing that excitement in their eyes is really exhilerating. My entire career is based on Discord, and so I like it, too, but I do prefer to be face to face so that I can interact with them.” #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Clip of their game]</p>
<p>Perhaps GDC 2022 is a means to reliving what was thought to be lost on game developers forever. Developers desire those real-time, embodied energies that circulate interpersonally at conferences through the in-person delivery of games.</p>
<p><i>Alt.Ctrl as Living Digital Media</i></p>
<p>One area of GDC 2022 that is emblamatic of desires for in-person conferencing is the Alt.Ctrl section of the expo floor. Alt.Ctrl is a special showcase dedicated to games that use alternative controllers, the kind that vary from mainstream controllers (e.g., Sony Playstation Dualshock and the Xbox One Controller; Steam Valve Index controllers). Game developers submit their games to GDC, and it selects a number for the showcase. On the expo floor, behind rows and rows and flashing lights, blaring music and screens, the Alt.Ctrl event is teeming with the curious. These are games that really don’t translate well to home consoles and personal computers—if at all. When I play the game <cite>NumberCruncher</cite> (ATLAS Institute, CU Boulder, 2022), it involves solving somewhat simple math problems and inputting the answers on a floor pad, then mining a monster’s gut to receive a coin. It’s a parody of mining for cryptocurrency. This sample video shows you what I mean.</p>
<p>[Link to video with permission from the creator]</p>
<p>"Pickles!”</p>
<p>Touring more of the Alt.Ctrl section, I hear someone shouting an order into what looks like a drive-thru cashier microphone, and all the while they’re holding a ketchup bottle in their left hand and a mustard bottle in the other. The game is <cite>Plinko Burger</cite>, created by Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, recent graduates of University of Colorado-Boulder (CU-Boulder). <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> is connected to a computer, yes, but how players interact with the computer is guided by these controllers. Sheikh and Vicker have decided to exhibit <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> for three days in a row—four if you count the day of setting up the game. Both are standing near the game, wearing aprons and yesteryear’s server hats. Sheikh and Vicker completed <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> when they were students in a game design class at CU-Boulder. In November 2021, they demo’d the game at The Whaaat!?Festival at the university. In a Zoom call after the conference, Sheikh tells me that the game received plenty of play and feedback at the Whaaat!? festival, the kind of feedback that made it a better game, something that would eventually be accepted among submissions to Alt.Ctrl. This is how Vicker recalls the Whaaat!? festival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I just remember watching and really enjoying was the different play styles people came up with for this game in particular; you can play it many different ways. I always like to yell over and over and try to get things to drop as much as they can while other people were very technical about calling out what ingredients and getting in it to the basket and then the next and then the next. And then we let a few people into the little shortcut keywords that we had and it was fun to watch them use them, and for other people that really confused them. So, just all the different play styles that we were coming up with and the people we were watching was really cool to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At GDC 2022, the two are handling the <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> booth all day. They have speakers playing the music and sound effects of the game, and they are surrounded by fellow developers, such as Yong Zhen Zhou and his baking game <cite>PASTRY PANIC (with Cat)</cite>. The energy of the space keeps them going all day, even if their feet and stomaches are aching. Sheikh recalls those embodied moments and the "vibe,” which seems only possible at the convention and not in online environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sheikh: And so, since we always had a line of people once the showcase had opened, we had a ton of people around the booth all the time, because we were kind of in the middle and we were next to a bunch of other games like <cite>Pastry Panic</cite>. Having the music was really fun because not only was it a clear indicator that the game someone was playing was over and then it was transitioning to the next player, but also it was just like a really fun, upbeat vibe for that sort of space. So, I think that was both good to keep our spirits up and also it was contributing to the vibe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After immersing myself as a drive-thru operator at Plinko Burger and failing hard, I turn around and get in line for Yong Zhen Zhou’s <cite>PASTRY PANIC (with Cat)</cite>. The game was developed as a final project during Yong Zhen Zhou’s studies at National University of Singapore. Looking to a screen with an adorable cat, players insert tiny kitchen tools (e.g., bread slicer, kneader) into two slots in a box in order to fulfil orders for baked goods. Inside the box, mirrors and a webcam identify the "haptic feedback sliders,” or kitchen tools, inserted into the box, rendering the player’s actions on screen ("PASTRY PANIC (with cat)”. The game also has a cookbook that players must consult as they go. The line is 10-people deep, with audiences waiting to use its alternative controllers. Several players collaborate when they play, one making pastries while the other reads aloud recipes. Playful panic indeed fills the air.</p>
<p>In a Zoom call after GDC, Yong Zhen Zhou and I are speaking about -PASTRY PANIC (with Cat)’-s development and his experience seeing it come together before a live audience. For GDC’s Alt.Ctrl showcase, he brought a few friends along to help with setting up the game. Listen as he describes the challenges of the game and friends serving as a "live patch” at GDC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cookbook is outside of the game because it’s meant to be part of the challenge in playing the game. It’s another thing to manage with your hands. You’re juggling these five different controllers in your hands and two different slots. You’re juggling the information on the screen. And now you’re juggling a third element, which is this cookbook that you need to flip through to get the information that you need to deal with, the stuff, the problems on the screen.<br>
<br>
Having the recipe book outside there, as an element for somebody to play with, opens up some possibilities in the social dynamics of the game, outside of the game…So, you can see here, that’s my friend Aaron holding the book for the person who’s playing the game there. And it’s something that we just do when we… Because ultimately we wanted people to have a good experience there. We wanted them to have fun while playing the game. So, if they’re struggling with some of the elements, we’ll hold the book for them or flip to the right page so it’s just smoother for them to play.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I guess you could call it a live patch to the game mechanics or something….some people would take pictures of the recipe book while other people were playing. So, while waiting in line, they took pictures of the book so that they could study up before playing the game, which is really fun to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Screen caps from the game and his narration above]</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Alt.Ctrl 2022 is that it’s offered at a time when many are still unnerved by pandemic conditions, such as being in proximity to others. At GDC 2022, masks are required inside, but distancing has relaxed a bit. GDC, and Alt.Ctrl for that matter, mark my first time in the United States since December 2020.  Triple vaxxed now, I find this event to be safe, thanks to organizers of the conference and their various health and safety measures. And I admit that my desire to sample experimental games like <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> and <cite>PASTRY PANIC (with cat)</cite> supercede my nervousness about attending public events in general. Alt.Ctrl showcases games that are difficult to access anywhere else. For example, Mouse &amp; the Billionaire’s <cite>Buy! Sell!</cite> requires three wired telephones and arduinos plus screens to convey rising and falling stocks ("Buy! Sell!”). The game <cite>Teletext WRN1</cite> is only available to play on televisions old enough to support the system and its interface (Jonas Müller, Nils Lange, Nino Coaz, Stefan Kraft, 2022). NumberCruncher, which I mentioned earlier, needs enough floor space for a rather large monster, a horizontal screen, and circle of numbers that players stomp on.  The point of Alt.Ctrl isn’t to market these games beyond GDC. While several of these games are available in some abridged way on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, a popular platform for independent developers, they just aren’t the same when taken out of the conference’s context. As Yong Zhen Zhou tells me about PASTRY PANIC (with cat), a player trying this at home would need a replication of his alternative controllers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yong Zhen Zhou: Obviously, PASTRY PANIC can’t really be played without the controller. So, it’s not like you can just download PASTRY PANIC on Steam and play PASTRY PANIC at home because that’s a different game now, although there’s certainly possibilities there. A lot of people at the convention were like, "Oh, yes. Is this going to be on Steam?” And I look at them and I look at my controller and I’ll be like, "Can this go on Steam?” Sure, maybe like a Kickstarter where I can send flat pack -PASTRY PANIC-s out to people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Echoing what Yong Zhen Zhou tells me, my point is is that GDC’s Alt.Ctrl is a rich example of living digital media, the kind that foregrounds the body’s interaction with devices and interfaces in games. Some of these games are updated after the fact, sure, but they often aren’t released prior to Alt.Ctrl. It’s an annual event, and some games’ shelf lives extend beyond the conference, even extending to additional conferences.</p>
<p><i>And the Winners are…</i></p>
<p>Where else did I go on the expo floor? Next to Alt.Ctrl are award winners and nominees of the Independent Games Festival (IGF), an annual competition in which peers in the industry evaluate games released by independent developers. IGF, in fact, was one exigence for this book, a kind of repository for seeing the latest and noteworthy independent games that experimented with writing, story, design, and more. (As noted earlier, I recruited a number of developers by looking at the 2020 list of nominees, and I’m grateful that many agreed to interview with me!). The IGF Pavillion features rows of nominated games that anyone can walk up to and play. The surprising thing to me is that none of the developers from the games are present to talk about their processes and such. The pavillion is more or less a space to demo the games. Let the games stand on their own.</p>
<p>[Video clip from the floor and a description of its location]</p>
<p>Later, I’m told that GDC might not be the best space to demo myriad games and talk with developers. This is more or less a peer-to-peer event, one where those in the industry are looking to augment to their work (i.e., sell it!). Panel talks are another facet of the conference, but I’m told the best experiences of the conference are those are happen in hallways, walks to different parts of the Moscone, bars, and sponsored afterparties. Again, I’m an outsider, a stranger in the industry. In some ways, it’s a relief. The pressure is off to perform as sometimes is necessary at academic conferences. I’m just a curious traveler who loves games and finds interesting connections between developers of games and digital media scholarship. GDC has solified such connections for me.</p>

    <h3>Living Updates and Documentation</h3>
<p>For many game developers, revisions to finished games are commonplace and well-documented. As Caravella and Holmes (2022) indicate, revisions are a matter of ethos construction in game development. Reviewing the "patch notes” of developer Jeff Kaplan, an update "builds his ethos as a player of the game by specifically gesturing to feedback received by players that lead to technical changes” (p. 7). For game developers such as Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, and Yong Zhen Zhou, updates to their games are not crucial because their games were designed for unique contexts and difficult to replicate on personal computers. However, many developers presenting games at the Game Developers Conference demo their works in progress and updated it after receiving feedback. Having covered feedback on works in progress in Chapter Three, though, I turn now to game developers who have published updates <i>to</i> and  <i>about</i> their games. These approaches ensure that a game lives on in public in some capacity.</p>
<p><i>Living Updates</i></p>
<p>It’s May 2021 and I’m watching Gabriel Branyiczky develop <cite>Worlds Within Worlds,</cite> a game he began developing during the 2021 Toronto Game Jam, first discussed in Chapter Three. Worlds Within Worlds is a two-dimensional "platformer” in which you move through worlds to "collect Golden Leaves to restore Trees.” (The game is free to play, but donations help future developments.) Branyiczky has participated in several game jams in Toronto and online spaces, including the very popular Ludum Dare, an international game jam that gives developers one month to conceive and distribute an independent game with certain themes and parameters. During TO Jam game, Branyiczky is livestreaming his development in ways we heard about in Chapter Three: talking aloud about the game’s mechanics, showing programs and code that make the game possible, and interacting with viewers. When a version of <cite>Worlds Within Worlds</cite> is published on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, it’s just the beginning for what John Gallagher (2020) would call <cite>Worlds Within Worlds’</cite> afterlife.</p>
<blockquote>
I would say that developers tend to approach their jam games in a few different mindsets. You know, there’s the people who are just making it for fun for a passion project, maybe even a portfolio piece someday down the line. And when they’re continuing work on a jam game, it’s because they want it to be a more complete version, so that if anyone sees it in the future, it’ll reflect well, on their work as a whole.
</blockquote>
<p>In July 2021, Branyiczky continues working on a more complete version of <cite>Worlds Within Worlds.</cite> We meet over Zoom for a meet-and-greet introductory interview, and then he invites me to join him on Twitch for a conversation about the game later in the week. It’s a means to interviewing him and allowing him to explain his process while his regular audience participates. In this excerpt, we are discussing his decision to prepare parts of the game before TO Jam and then expand on them after the event. Listen as he describes revising and adding levels to <cite>Worlds Within Worlds.</cite></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich: I noticed with Worlds Within Worlds you said in the description that you developed some of the assets of the game ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Branyiczky: Oh yes, so much of your game is built ahead of time, like the the only thing that I was doing for the jam was the level design. Everything else is built.<br>
<br>
Rich: How many levels do or do you anticipate having for worlds within worlds?[Splice audio together.<br>
<br>
Branyiczky: Well, so right now, there are three worlds and the version of the game that is out there, you can play in each world has five levels in it. And then right now, I’ve just finished world four. So that’s the total up to 20. And I want you to at least, finish world five and see where I’m at with that. Um, so there’s going to be at least 25 levels in the game. But if I still feel like I have more ideas and more, sort of, like, elements of the game that I want to play this like that was one thing you can see on here is that world one is introducing a lot of the basic mechanics of the game. World two is jellies then a puzzle, a challenge involving wind, then another challenge involving jellies then another challenge involving wind and then challenge involving jellies tossed whipped. And then same thing with World three, it’s the little boost blocks you have to hit and then jump on them before they fade away, then it’s a little curl ups, then it’s those blocks to then I took the goats out of here and move them into a different part of the game. But then you’ve got the sort of challenge of the roll ups and the DOS dos. And it’s the same thing. World four is a like introducing one element, then introducing other elements, then playing a harder version of maps of each and then seeing how those two elements interact. And it’ll be the same world five, and it might even be the same with another world as long as I can continue to come up with these sorts of elements that are fun on their own, and then are fun in combination with one another. No.
<br>
<br>
GB: there’s a massive list of all the levels that I have in the game that are in the engine, I should say. And some of them are scrapped. Some of them are original versions of others that I’ve redone since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[GIF and Caption: GB’s process working on <cite>Worlds Within Worlds</cite>.]</p>
<p>Branyiczky’s experiences underscore the value of living digital media even as a solo developer. It doesn’t take a massive team to make living digital media, but it can be massive undertaking on one’s part—weeks and weeks of streaming, pushing constant and periodic updates, to get work done. To boot, audiences who play the game—even audiences that are smaller in size—contribute to the game and its developers’ liveliness. This confluence of interactive feedback and public collaboration amount to the affective charges (Stewart, 2007) that the practice of living digital media depends on. Branyiczky argues that he streams and updates the games even when noone’s watching. Perhaps it is streaming that kickstarts the heartbeat of his constant updates to a game that was finished during a game jam. To offer a sense of Branyiczky living digital media, and the positive vibes that stem from it, I invite you to listen this section with one final excerpt from our chat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The thing that’s really beneficial about keeping myself on such a rigid schedule is the fact that it means that - however small the steps that I am accomplishing on any given stream are - it’s giving me an opportunity to just keep making steps forward. I definitely have gone through various phases, like years, of my life, where I just feel like I’m not getting very much done, not working towards the dreams, not engaging in hobbies, and not working towards whatever it is I really want to be making. I find that taking time out to participate in the stream and the fact that I’ve actually got an audience here, I feel somewhat accountable to maintain the consistency of the stream to be here, in some small form, as an entertainer, but also as a part of this community. It’s a great opportunity for me to mostly focus on actually working towards the development of my own games, but also for me to participate in conversations with chats and with other game developers and do interviews. It’s been a very positive thing for me. I figured, even if I only have like one, two viewers - in this case, we’re up to five, which is great - even if I had next to nobody watching me, I’d still keep doing this specifically because of the fact that it’s afforded me this time to work on my art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sum, Branyiczky has made virtual space for living digital media and the updates that come alive in real time. Like Branyiczky, many devs featured in this book have published updates to their games. I refer once again to House House’s <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite> and its August 2020 update: "Oh dear! Two horrible geese!</p>
<p>Soon you’ll be able to enjoy <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite> with a friend, in a new two-player cooperative mode. Play through the whole game as two horrible geese, honking twice as much, teaming up to plan pranks, and generally ruining everyone’s day, together” (Nintendo, 2020). As I emphasized in this book, developers need considerable time to update their projects, let alone while streaming in public. The perpetual motion of living digital media means perpetual invention. However, a project can live on in less intense yet meaningful ways. This is why documentation about games is important to acknowledge.</p>
<p><i>On Documentation</i></p>
<p>In addition to updating actual games, developers also write comprehensive documents detailing their updates and reflecting on their overall development processes. On the <cite>Worlds Within Worlds</cite> page, Branyiczky publishes "change logs” to the game, a recent one featuring updates such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><cite>Individual Level Best-Time Tracking: Your best attempt at clearing each level will be recorded and shown above each level’s gate in the overworld with Speedrun Mode enabled</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Quick Erase Progress: Erase all progress to make a fresh run at the game; Number "0” key or "R” while paused</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Bug Fixes;</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>The cursor no longer remains invisible if you pause or reset the game while the butterfly is active</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>The in-game timer no longer counts frames to determine time passed and so should be more accurate</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Fixed instantaneous level transitions</cite></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><cite>Minor tweak to level 1-5 to make a speedrun path more consistent</cite></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Branyicsky’s change logs are similar to the patch notes of Kaplan that "purposefully construct a particular narrative and rationale for both technical and aesthetic changes made to the game” (Caravella &amp; Holmes, 2022). However they are labeled, such writings are updates that responsive to the developer’s new ideas and feedback from players. Some are objective, simply describing what changes were made. Others, like Kaplan, take a multimodal approach, placing their bodies and voices on screen. The latter approach is an affectively rich delivery practice that helps recirculate content updates to global audiences. While global circulation can spawn satiric remixes of updates (see Caravella &amp; Holmes, 2022), it can also create "flows and rhythms that cultivate new ideas for a serial installment [or update]” (Bahl &amp; Shivener, 2020).</p>
<p>Sheikh and Vicker demonstrated the value of latter as they released versions of <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> on the website <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> and documented their process on a GitHub page, where visitors can check out their raw files and version changes. As Sheikh and Vicker tell me during our conversation on Zoom, documentation is the concurrent text of a project, a means to recalling successes and failures. It is also a way of giving back to the community that supports a game’s development. Put differently, if fellow game devs support a development during a production cycle, then documentation is a good way to pay that support forward. While documentation is more low-key than content updates to a game, but it’s still a crucial public service as much as it is crucial for raising a developer’s profile in the industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zayna Sheikh: The process of making a game is so variable and it takes you on crazy paths through different ideas and different prototypes and different experiences, and all of that is so awesome and valuable that if you do documentation while it’s happening, you have this amazing record of, sure we made this thing, but also we went on this journey to making this thing and learning about what it takes to bring this idea forward, that the better documentation you do, the more you can look back on that and have that as its own body of work to show other people and to help other people with their own development and to have as this updating body of work that you can look at and be like, "Here, this is how I did this. This is what it took to make this project. This was my thought process in making this thing a reality,” and there’s so much value in that, that I have grown to appreciate as I’ve continued to work on creative projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> might not be updated much after GDC, but its presence will live on as long as the two sustain the documentation about it on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> and Github. Combined with the game’s digital files on such sites, their documentation ensures that their game remains a living project, capable of being replicated or referenced for future projects. Without such documentation, future developers might be less aware of how Alt.Ctrl and experimental projects take shape. This is a call I return to in the final section of Chapter 4.</p>

    <h3>A Scholarly DLC, Webtext Arcade and Process Document: Writing Studies as Living Digital Media</h3>
<p>At the start of this chapter, I stated what might be a given among scholars: When a manuscript is published, whether it’s in print or in a digital space, it’s done. We move on the next one, the next manuscript that helps us add another crucial line to our CV. So my first question in this final section of Chapter Four is this&mdash;can we afford to make updates to digital media scholarship in response to its initial public circulation and reader feedback? What’s at stake for those who attempt—and have attempted—this delivery approach?</p>
<p><i>Scholarly DLCs</i></p>
<p>There is a fine line between releasing projects in progress and updating it after its publication. Echoing my comments in Chapter Two, I would argue that Nathaniel Rivers and Jeremy Tirrell’s <cite>Following Mechanical Turks</cite> project is living digital media in progress, similar to games under Steam’s Early Access program. Rivers and Tirrell have uploaded more than 100 files to the project’s repository since 2019. They livestream discussions about their project and release notes and features of it. (By the time this book is in circulation, they might be done.) However, it doesn’t appear that the team is directly engaging with constant feedback on features and writings of the project. Still, their project’s approach constitutes a combination of highly visible collaboration in situ. At the time of writing this chapter, I wonder what updates will take place after the project is fully published. I wonder this, too, about the very project that you are reading now.</p>
<p>For this discussion, I’m most interested in projects that have been in circulation as final projects. For example, Alexander Hidalgo’s (2017) video book, <cite>Cámara Retórica: A Feminist Filmmaking Methodology for Rhetoric and Composition</cite>, is a six-part series of short films on feminist filmmaking practices and its practitioners. How has this project evolved since its publication in 2017? This question is not designed to critique Hidalgo’s completed work, but to evoke wonder about what insights have emerged since <em>Cámara Retórica</em>’s publication. Wonder is a feeling that digital media projects can embrace well, according to Susan Delagrange (2011).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Interactive digtial media can be designed as technologies of wonder, epistemically active digital <cite>Wunderkammern</cite>, spaces where we can accumulate, explore, and make meaning from a superabundance of visual, verbal, and auditory materials in digital formats.” (p. 153, Delagrange)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like games, digital media scholarship can foreground wonder through navigation choice and updates after publication. In 2019, Jason Helms published "Play Smarter Not Harder: Developing Your Scholarly Meta” in the open-access electronic journal, <cite>Scholarly and Research Communication</cite>. In "Play Smarter,” you take on the role of a scholar who is writing at article over a 50-day period. In this text-based game, you make decisions about committing time to drafting print or digital media, conducting research, revising your project, and taking time off. It’s a game that branches as you go, revealing your days left, your page count, and your emotional states. As it tells me in a recent playthrough, "Pages written: You have written 0 of your planned 25 pages. Emotions: you perceive yourself as more challenged than skilled, leaving you feeling anxious.” A complete playthrough of the game unlocks a "a debug mode that makes its arguments more explicit.”</p>
<p>[GIF of a game in progress]</p>
<p>Caption: A brief demonstration of Jason Helms’ text-based game-as-scholarship, Play Smarter Not Harder: Developing Your Scholarly Meta, published in the open-access electronic journal, Scholarly and Research Communication. This GIF depicts a web browser and linkable text with sentences such as "(#check)  .”</p>
<p>Since its publication on July 2, 2019, the game has not been updated—or perhaps updates haven’t been publicly announced (e.g., on the journal’s website). And that makes sense. Unlike what we see on games pages at <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> and Steam, a page detailing change logs are practically nonexistent on the pages of digital media scholarship. It’s not an expectation of the field of writing studies and academia writ large. If we have textual and technical errors in a digital argument, we fix it or we contact editors to help us. (This dialogue happens every so often at the online journal for which I edit.) We often don’t make updates public knowledge. Generally, when the article is published, that’s it. Done. The article’s link circulates in inboxes, social media feeds, and professional portfolios. This circulation is what my department calls knowledge mobilization.</p>
<p>To align with the rhetorical-affective production cycles of game devs, then, what updates for "Play Smarter Not Harder” would be appropriate? Helms might add an update, such as "the second article.” It would be a scholarly downloadable content (DLC). Or perhaps he might unlock debug mode for anyone to play through. Within the game, Helms’ comment on prototyping prompts me think about the lifespan of feedback in scholarship vs. game development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to think that all scholarship is academic prototyping. In a long view, scholarly interventions are feedback mechanisms, but they’re not that rapid. In my own experience, I’ve found that new media scholarship offers more opportunities for immediate feedback to improve the prototype.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Toward the Webtext Arcade</i></p>
<p>If all scholarship is academic prototyping, how do we extend its feedback mechanisms beyond initial publication and capture the labour that figures into such an extension? One idea is to encourage reinterpreting a piece for another publication or venue. These reinterpreations happen in ethical ways all the time in our field, as we’re parlaying works in progress or finished articles into presentations at field conferences or vice versa. In fact, in 2008, Jacqueline Rhodes and Jonathan Alexander presented the multimedia installation "Multimedia[ted] [E]visceration” at the Watson Conference at the University of Louisville. The installation was later published as a webtext chapter in <cite>The New Work of Composing</cite> (2012). That said, a game like Helms—and many of the digtial media scholarship examples discussed in this book—could be arranged for a kind of webtext installation, similar to GDC’s Alt.Ctrl. At the Computers and Writing 2022 conference, in fact, the organizers highlighted several presenters as "emergent voices.” These voices were invited to create virtual projects ahead of the conference and participate in Q&amp;A sessions about their projects at the in-person conference. This intentional approach to invite participants to engage with digital projects at the conference more closely aligned with the demonstrations by game developers featured in this chapter. These scholars received immediate feedback in digital and physical spaces and could carry them forward to manuscripts.</p>
<p>Installing and sharing work this way is also similar to poster presentations at conferences. The Conference on College Composition and Communication and Computers and Writing conference have poster sessions and welcome media-rich presentations. Perhaps Computers and Writing is the best conference space for blending in-person and digital interactions with works-in-progress and published webtexts. While the conference presentation as a genre is interactive, a dedicated space, a kind of open arcade for webtexts might allow for more attendee agency and temporally flexible ways of giving and receiving feedback. The DMAC Institute at The Ohio State University commits an afternoon for participants to showcase their work to staff, faculty advisors and fellow participants in an open format. For example, a draft video I composed at DMAC 2018 was displayed on a computer and accompanied by a notebook in which viewers could leave anonymous comments, a kind of low-key proxy of posting comments on a YouTube video. While my project afforded passive viewing, the arrangement of the event and the delivery of the project felt interactive and welcomed rapid, immediate feedback.</p>

<p>Caption: A notebook redacted with handwritten comments about the author’s video submission at the DMAC Institute. IF I CAN FIND IT!</p>
<p>Similar to DMAC, the webtext arcade could run for an entire day or concurrently with the conference programming, much like Alt.Ctrl on GDC’s expo floor. But I hazard to strongly suggest that it run throughout the conference due to the notably time committment of presenting said webtext. As Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker told me in our interview about Alt.Ctrl, demonstrating <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> required hours and hours of standing and talking with people for three days in a row: "We had the support of all those people around, but we were very focused on running the booths the whole time. So, there was a lot of back-to-back just talking to people for like six hours and running this game and having that experience. I think we didn’t have any major technical issues, which was pretty wonderful.”</p>

<p>Caption: A GIF of Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker dancing at the convention.</p>
<p>An approach like this might be a big ask for digital media scholarship. Simply put, hosting a poster or project at a table or booth in a public space all day isn’t a disciplinary expectation. And let’s own up to something: We aren’t selling a game.</p>
<p>Perhaps the middle ground is something like the aforementioned IGF Pavilion, where conference participants can freely play games. A computer lab demonstrating all the works might do the rhetorical trick. Furthermore, many academic institutions have labs for these activities already. The Webtext Arcade could be a productive partnership with an institution’s library, which have in their own ways become sites of media production (Mackenzie &amp; Martin, 2016; Nelson, 2021). That said, what might be the specific asks? Immediately, I think of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 computers connected to Ethernet</li>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Movable tables</li>
</ul>
<p>These asks are commonplace items in labs and the kind of installation setups at gaming conventions. Perhaps the biggest ask is the promotion of the arcade and incentive to present. We need to further recognize and celebrate myriad works of digital media scholarship—past, present and future, particularly those on the horizon. Beyond appearing in digital publications and institutes, a webtext arcade could amplify living digital media in our field, perhaps even resulting in more submissions.</p>
<p><i>Documenting Our Work</i></p>
<p>Aside from the two above approaches, documentation might be the best option for extending the lifespan of digital media scholarship. As I argue earlier in this book, we need to publicly document and reflect on our digital media scholarship more often, and we need to do a better job of arguing that documentation is a public-facing service. Whether modeling after Brayicsky’s change logs or Sheikh and Vicker’s documentation on GitHub, tracking and writing about our revisions can be an enormous resource for fellow and future scholars. While drafting and revising a webtext, scholars might record their screens, capture screenshots of every draft, and upload versions to GitHub. This stuff, what I call ephemera, accompanies the revised submissions we collect from students. Ephemera allows for a contextualized assessment of the revised submission. Asking for and submitting ephemera animates the interpersonal circulation of a production, foregrounding a culture of affective openness that forms between bodies.</p>
<p>Let me put it frankly: For many of us, writing a webtext is hard as hell. For our peers and reviewers, let’s document how we made our way out of development hell.</p>
