<h3>Living Digital Media at a Conference</h3>
<p>We might say that 2022 was a watershed year for conferences, as many returned to in-person programming for the first time in two years. In this section, I turn to stories of developers who delivered finished games at the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March 2022. To emphasize the conference’s lively context, I focus on developers such as Zayna Sheikh, David Vicker, and Yong Zhen Zhou, who presented in GDC’s special showcase Alt.Ctrl, which celebrates games with alternative controllers. Their stories occasion a question I entertain at the end of this chapter: What if writing studies scholars presented webtexts in a live format?</p>
<p>Before I tell their stories, some scene setting of GDC is necessary for understanding its lively context.</p>
<p><i>Inside the Game Developers Conference</i></p>
<p>It’s a Wednesday in March 2022 and I’ve just arrived at GDC in San Francisco. GDC is an annual gathering for game developers, publishers and businesses associated with the industry, featuring a weeks’ worth of game demonstrations, panels, and such. (It just so happens that I lost my wallet just after I got off the plane, but that story’s for another day.) The streets are bustling with those who live and work here, but the intersection of Howard and 4th Street is teeming with those wearing conference badges, laptop bags, and video game and technology t-shirts. As I note in early passages of the book, my trip to physical GDC was delayed by two years due to pandemic cancellations. GDC 2020 and 2021 were entirely virtual. To boot, despite wading through what seems like a massive gathering, I’m told in San Francisco that GDC 2022 is scaled down significantly when compared to past GDCs. No giant displays by Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft. No massive after-parties. Small rows of game demos and tables.  But to me, this seems like a manageable introduction to the event. When I attended San Diego Comic Con International for the first time in 2012,  I was overwhelmed by the lights and cacophony of booths and showcases on the convention floor—the allatonceness of the convention. GDC 22 is not like that, but it is still a worthwhile trip.</p>
<p>[GIF or short clip of the outside of the conference.]</p>
<p>GDC’s organization team is on top of pandemic-related protocols for health and safety. Upon arriving, I’m directed three different times to the required entrance to the line for checking in, sharing vaccine passports, etc… The line is long, and rightfully so. It’s the first in-person GDC in two years, feeling like the “annual gathering of video game creators from across the world that in most ways resembled a return to the good old pre-COVID days—save for the masks on everybody’s faces. Well, on almost everybody’s faces” (Grayson and Liao, 2022) I’m masked, but I’m not entirely comfortable—mainly because I haven’t been around large crowds for two years. The idea of mingling, eating, or just being, at an event like this reminds that I’ve kind of forgotten how to interact with 3D people. How to make eye contact. How close to stand, assuming we’re both vaccinated. These social elements aren’t the easiet either in a convention space. With music blasting at a motion capture demonstration booth nearby, for example, I’m having trouble communicating with a developer of a virtual reality system. We occasionally pull our masks down to punctuate the air between us. Again, I’m not entirely comfortable, but I’m grateful to be here.</p>
<p>My research goal for the convention reveals itself when I arrive at the North Hall of the Moscone Center. I pass the GDC Arcade chairs, controllers and screens that offer historically famous games from the convention (e.g., Wolfenstein 3D on Super Nintendo). I pass the third-party vendors selling games, merch, and such. Moments later, I find rows game developers and companies organized by region: Chile, Switzerland, France, Quebec. I play demos of games such as <cite>Legion Hearts</cite> from Switzerland and <cite>Shadow’s Light: Tale of the Champions</cite> from Montreal. Say hello. Take a card. Play. Say hello. Take a card. Play. Thank you. At one point, I’m wearing a VR hearset and learning how to parry and slash in Thirdverse’s forthcoming sword-fighting game <cite>Altair Breaker</cite>. The company had traveled from (#location) to preview the game at GDC. The North Hall of the expo floor keeps attendees like me busy for hours. With controllers and systems ready to go, game developers get rapid public testing with players and consideration for funders and publishers.</p>
<p>This is David Martin speaking about conferencing and live playthroughs in general. His company Barnaque tested their experimental game <cite>Infini</cite> at several conferences before it was finished.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started play tested the game from the beginning because we’ve been going to events a lot. We went to 12 events, I think just with Infini. We would make the demo so in a way that would be some kind of play testing, on the demo we had a seven minute time limit. And after that it would say thanks for playing and we have the newsletter prompt. So what that would do is there would be more people trying the game because like if someone liked the game, and was interrupted after the game, he’ll have the impression that he liked the game and he wants to know more. I didn’t feel cheap cutting it off after that, and people who didn’t like the game, of course, they would just move on. It would allow us to let more people try to play the game. We would show different parts in different events. It would really act as a playtest, because some things would just become super apparent. For example, if everybody would get stuck on this specific level for some reason, then we’d figure out and we’d retry it in another event, and then it would be fixed, we would see it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At GDC 2022, many developers still feel that presenting to live audience is worth it, even if health and safety protocols make interactions somewhat awkward. This is what developers Evan (#check last name) and Andrew (#check last name) tell me as they sit at small table, sharing a physical card game, <cite>Last Call for Alcohol</cite>, and their Discord channel for the game (#check game). <cite>Last Call for Alcohol</cite> is a game in which you pass around cards and attempt to get the lowest values. The player with the highest value drinks. In a way, drinking is punishment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evan: “To me, it’s indescribable, but It’s kind of a feeling of pride and genuine wholehearted happiness. The reason why I create games is because I want to see people enjoying the thing that I create. Being able to see them smile and see the lights in their eyes when they get that design that I’m going for, when they get that ah-ha moment int he core gameplay loop, it kind of feels like adrenaline.” #soundcite<br>
<br>
Andrew: “I prefer face-to-face. I get a lot of energy while I’m descriving my game to people. Seeing that excitement in their eyes is really exhilerating. My entire career is based on Discord, and so I like it, too, but I do prefer to be face to face so that I can interact with them.” #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Clip of their game]</p>
<p>Perhaps GDC 2022 is a means to reliving what was thought to be lost on game developers forever. Developers desire those real-time, embodied energies that circulate interpersonally at conferences through the in-person delivery of games.</p>
<p><i>Alt.Ctrl as Living Digital Media</i></p>
<p>One area of GDC 2022 that is emblamatic of desires for in-person conferencing is the Alt.Ctrl section of the expo floor. Alt.Ctrl is a special showcase dedicated to games that use alternative controllers, the kind that vary from mainstream controllers (e.g., Sony Playstation Dualshock and the Xbox One Controller; Steam Valve Index controllers). Game developers submit their games to GDC, and it selects a number for the showcase. On the expo floor, behind rows and rows and flashing lights, blaring music and screens, the Alt.Ctrl event is teeming with the curious. These are games that really don’t translate well to home consoles and personal computers—if at all. When I play the game <cite>NumberCruncher</cite> (ATLAS Institute, CU Boulder, 2022), it involves solving somewhat simple math problems and inputting the answers on a floor pad, then mining a monster’s gut to receive a coin. It’s a parody of mining for cryptocurrency. This sample video shows you what I mean.</p>
<p>[Link to video with permission from the creator]</p>
<p>“Pickles!”</p>
<p>Touring more of the Alt.Ctrl section, I hear someone shouting an order into what looks like a drive-thru cashier microphone, and all the while they’re holding a ketchup bottle in their left hand and a mustard bottle in the other. The game is <cite>Plinko Burger</cite>, created by Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker, recent graduates of University of Colorado-Boulder (CU-Boulder). <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> is connected to a computer, yes, but how players interact with the computer is guided by these controllers. Sheikh and Vicker have decided to exhibit <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> for three days in a row—four if you count the day of setting up the game. Both are standing near the game, wearing aprons and yesteryear’s server hats. Sheikh and Vicker completed <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> when they were students in a game design class at CU-Boulder. In November 2021, they demo’d the game at The Whaaat!?Festival at the university. In a Zoom call after the conference, Sheikh tells me that the game received plenty of play and feedback at the Whaaat!? festival, the kind of feedback that made it a better game, something that would eventually be accepted among submissions to Alt.Ctrl. This is how Vicker recalls the Whaaat!? festival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I just remember watching and really enjoying was the different play styles people came up with for this game in particular; you can play it many different ways. I always like to yell over and over and try to get things to drop as much as they can while other people were very technical about calling out what ingredients and getting in it to the basket and then the next and then the next. And then we let a few people into the little shortcut keywords that we had and it was fun to watch them use them, and for other people that really confused them. So, just all the different play styles that we were coming up with and the people we were watching was really cool to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At GDC 2022, the two are handling the <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> booth all day. They have speakers playing the music and sound effects of the game, and they are surrounded by fellow developers, such as Yong Zhen Zhou and his baking game <cite>PASTRY PANIC (with Cat)</cite>. The energy of the space keeps them going all day, even if their feet and stomaches are aching. Sheikh recalls those embodied moments and the “vibe,” which seems only possible at the convention and not in online environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sheikh: And so, since we always had a line of people once the showcase had opened, we had a ton of people around the booth all the time, because we were kind of in the middle and we were next to a bunch of other games like <cite>Pastry Panic</cite>. Having the music was really fun because not only was it a clear indicator that the game someone was playing was over and then it was transitioning to the next player, but also it was just like a really fun, upbeat vibe for that sort of space. So, I think that was both good to keep our spirits up and also it was contributing to the vibe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After immersing myself as a drive-thru operator at Plinko Burger and failing hard, I turn around and get in line for Yong Zhen Zhou’s <cite>PASTRY PANIC (with Cat)</cite>. The game was developed as a final project during Yong Zhen Zhou’s studies at National University of Singapore. Looking to a screen with an adorable cat, players insert tiny kitchen tools (e.g., bread slicer, kneader) into two slots in a box in order to fulfil orders for baked goods. Inside the box, mirrors and a webcam identify the “haptic feedback sliders,” or kitchen tools, inserted into the box, rendering the player’s actions on screen (“PASTRY PANIC (with cat)”. The game also has a cookbook that players must consult as they go. The line is 10-people deep, with audiences waiting to use its alternative controllers. Several players collaborate when they play, one making pastries while the other reads aloud recipes. Playful panic indeed fills the air.</p>
<p>In a Zoom call after GDC, Yong Zhen Zhou and I are speaking about _PASTRY PANIC (with Cat)’_s development and his experience seeing it come together before a live audience. For GDC’s Alt.Ctrl showcase, he brought a few friends along to help with setting up the game. Listen as he describes the challenges of the game and friends serving as a “live patch” at GDC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cookbook is outside of the game because it’s meant to be part of the challenge in playing the game. It’s another thing to manage with your hands. You’re juggling these five different controllers in your hands and two different slots. You’re juggling the information on the screen. And now you’re juggling a third element, which is this cookbook that you need to flip through to get the information that you need to deal with, the stuff, the problems on the screen.<br>
<br>
Having the recipe book outside there, as an element for somebody to play with, opens up some possibilities in the social dynamics of the game, outside of the game…So, you can see here, that’s my friend Aaron holding the book for the person who’s playing the game there. And it’s something that we just do when we… Because ultimately we wanted people to have a good experience there. We wanted them to have fun while playing the game. So, if they’re struggling with some of the elements, we’ll hold the book for them or flip to the right page so it’s just smoother for them to play.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I guess you could call it a live patch to the game mechanics or something….some people would take pictures of the recipe book while other people were playing. So, while waiting in line, they took pictures of the book so that they could study up before playing the game, which is really fun to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Screen caps from the game and his narration above]</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Alt.Ctrl 2022 is that it’s offered at a time when many are still unnerved by pandemic conditions, such as being in proximity to others. At GDC 2022, masks are required inside, but distancing has relaxed a bit. GDC, and Alt.Ctrl for that matter, mark my first time in the United States since December 2020.  Triple vaxxed now, I find this event to be safe, thanks to organizers of the conference and their various health and safety measures. And I admit that my desire to sample experimental games like <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> and <cite>PASTRY PANIC (with cat)</cite> supercede my nervousness about attending public events in general. Alt.Ctrl showcases games that are difficult to access anywhere else. For example, Mouse &amp; the Billionaire’s <cite>Buy! Sell!</cite> requires three wired telephones and arduinos plus screens to convey rising and falling stocks (“Buy! Sell!”). The game <cite>Teletext WRN1</cite> is only available to play on televisions old enough to support the system and its interface (Jonas Müller, Nils Lange, Nino Coaz, Stefan Kraft, 2022). NumberCruncher, which I mentioned earlier, needs enough floor space for a rather large monster, a horizontal screen, and circle of numbers that players stomp on.  The point of Alt.Ctrl isn’t to market these games beyond GDC. While several of these games are available in some abridged way on <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, a popular platform for independent developers, they just aren’t the same when taken out of the conference’s context. As Yong Zhen Zhou tells me about PASTRY PANIC (with cat), a player trying this at home would need a replication of his alternative controllers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yong Zhen Zhou: Obviously, PASTRY PANIC can’t really be played without the controller. So, it’s not like you can just download PASTRY PANIC on Steam and play PASTRY PANIC at home because that’s a different game now, although there’s certainly possibilities there. A lot of people at the convention were like, “Oh, yes. Is this going to be on Steam?” And I look at them and I look at my controller and I’ll be like, “Can this go on Steam?” Sure, maybe like a Kickstarter where I can send flat pack _PASTRY PANIC_s out to people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Echoing what Yong Zhen Zhou tells me, my point is is that GDC’s Alt.Ctrl is a rich example of living digital media, the kind that foregrounds the body’s interaction with devices and interfaces in games. Some of these games are updated after the fact, sure, but they often aren’t released prior to Alt.Ctrl. It’s an annual event, and some games’ shelf lives extend beyond the conference, even extending to additional conferences.</p>
<p><i>And the Winners are…</i></p>
<p>Where else did I go on the expo floor? Next to Alt.Ctrl are award winners and nominees of the Independent Games Festival (IGF), an annual competition in which peers in the industry evaluate games released by independent developers. IGF, in fact, was one exigence for this book, a kind of repository for seeing the latest and noteworthy independent games that experimented with writing, story, design, and more. (As noted earlier, I recruited a number of developers by looking at the 2020 list of nominees, and I’m grateful that many agreed to interview with me!). The IGF Pavillion features rows of nominated games that anyone can walk up to and play. The surprising thing to me is that none of the developers from the games are present to talk about their processes and such. The pavillion is more or less a space to demo the games. Let the games stand on their own.</p>
<p>[Video clip from the floor and a description of its location]</p>
<p>Later, I’m told that GDC might not be the best space to demo myriad games and talk with developers. This is more or less a peer-to-peer event, one where those in the industry are looking to augment to their work (i.e., sell it!). Panel talks are another facet of the conference, but I’m told the best experiences of the conference are those are happen in hallways, walks to different parts of the Moscone, bars, and sponsored afterparties. Again, I’m an outsider, a stranger in the industry. In some ways, it’s a relief. The pressure is off to perform as sometimes is necessary at academic conferences. I’m just a curious traveler who loves games and finds interesting connections between developers of games and digital media scholarship. GDC has solified such connections for me.</p>
