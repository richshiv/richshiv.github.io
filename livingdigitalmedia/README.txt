This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)

<!--This book trailer was designed to set the affective tone for the book. For audio and video elements in this book, I have enjoyed coding the transcript as an HTML table that divides the video and audio. Transcripts are often linked as PDFs, a fine option that ensures accessibility for readers. However, my view is that coded transcripts make them feel like a part, rather than seperate entity, of the page. A coded transcript also feels more interactive for users. That said, I simply added an expansion button at the top of each transcript so that it can be read with ease.-->
