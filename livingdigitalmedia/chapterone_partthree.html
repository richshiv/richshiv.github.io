<h3>Revising with Feedback: Woeful Responses</h3>        

<p>Feelings about revision are much different when compared to those of collaboration. According to participants in my study of webtext authors and their productions, revising in response to reviewer feedback was a common practice in which negative feelings arose in the rhetorical-affective production cycle, compelling the author(s) to circle back to drafting practices, such as writing and coding. Let’s consider how Henry discusses his experience with reviewers of his digital book:</p>  
                                
<blockquote>I wish the positive stuff (about producing a webtext) jumped out but it’s always of course the negative things, the things you didn’t like. (Reviewers) did say nice things too, I swear. But the things that jump out were a sense of disorganization. And a sense that it was too long. And both things, the two things together were really interesting to me. The original version that I turned in had this table of contents that looked kind of like a word cloud where there were these little sub clouds. It was really, really, to me, well-structured, but there was a lot of structure to it. Maybe overly structured. (personal communication, February 22, 2018) 
</blockquote>
<p>Henry’s recollection is indicative of the design and coding work done by webtext authors and the reviews that follow. For digital media scholarship, reviewers often have much more to say about a draft of a digital media production than an author might see in a feedback letter from a more traditional journal or publishing venue (e.g., <cite>Computers and Composition</cite> versus <cite>Computers and Composition Online</cite>). A number of participants spoke about lengthy review letters that cover the various elements of a webtext. Consider what Brooke said when she described reviewer feedback on her webtext in contrast to feedback she received on a submission to a community writing journal.</p>   
 
<blockquote>For my community writing piece it was shared and the editor letter said, “This is the overall concern based on reviewer feedback, and here’s my annotated version of your piece&mdash;fix it.” Whereas webtext reviewers discuss design concerns, content concerns, and how they play together. That’s so different to me, because when you’re rewriting the content you have to think about how it’s gonna look on the page . . . especially with a webtext journal that doesn’t necessarily want everything to be linear.  (personal communication, February 5, 2018)</blockquote>
<p>Brooke’s insight underscores that lengthy feedback on webtexts can lead to time-consuming and potentially overwhelming revision work, even if the feedback is intended to be formative for junior scholars. .The time needed to engage with the feedback and revise a webtext can be considerably more than that for a print article. Of all participants in this study, Brooke perhaps felt the most, in her words, “embroiled” and pained by the lengthy revision process&mdash;as indicated by her willingness to speak frankly about her experiences with revising a webtext. In the webtext, the author is writing about potentially harmful social media in writing classrooms. As the video below indicates, her initial draft of the webtext was constructed with the drag-and-drop platform Wix. Later, the webtext was coded with Creative Commons web templates. In response to reviewer feedback, Brooke’s webtext was revised and recirculated to reviewers three times, during which she rewrote, recoded, and redesigned her webtext.</p>    

<p>[Media to be placed][SOUNDBITE QUOTE AND BRIEF VIDEO ON BROOKE’S WORK]</p> 
<p>Brooke’s  pain of revision was amplified by an embodied moment during a social gathering with peers in her graduate program. One advanced graduate student, also an editor for an online journal, told Brooke that he knew the status of her revised webtext before she learned of it.</p>     
<blockquote>Somebody asked me, “Hey, have you heard about your (webtext)?” And I said, “No, I haven’t.” And then this guy, (the editor), had to be “Mister Guy” (and) was like, “Oh, I know what’s going on with it,” and told me things that I probably shouldn’t have known, and then later I got the feedback and so I already knew it was going to not be accepted again, and I also had this weird, like, orientation of well, “This person didn’t like it and thought we shouldn’t publish it.” It made me take the feedback a lot harder.  (personal communication, February 5, 2018)</blockquote>
<p>“Mister Guy” wasn’t doing Brooke any favors, but he was giving her a reason to physically stop revising her webtext. He didn’t help her move forward. Brooke isn’t alone in harbouring negative feelings over the course of revising and recirculating her project to reviewers. In Lane’s case, his vision for a digital monograph took a totally different turn when reviewers told him that “it looks like a slideshow.” At first, it was defeating. In Henry’s case, reviewers “hated” what they called his “expressive table of contents.” Furthermore, collaborators Ian and Nick spoke of their surprise to see 14 pages of single-spaced feedback from the review board, five members of which wrote critiques. This webtext went through two “tiers” of review, during which all board members of the journal could provide feedback. Here is an example from the opening pages of their feedback letter:</p>  
<blockquote>Earlier reviewers at the Tier 1 level did indicate that they found your webtext fairly text-heavy. At the Tier 2 (Editorial Board) level, readers seemed to focus more on the content than the design, but did have some suggestions for tweaks to the design to make the webtext more user-friendly throughout. 
<br>For example, one reviewer suggested “you might consider enabling users to adjust the size of the graphs to adapt to their display. (Mobile display looks great in both iOS and Android.)” 
<br>Also, regarding your photos, you will need to provide ALT text, captions, and APA-style citations on your references list for these images. . . . A reviewer also suggested, “It would also be nice if one could access a higher resolution image by clicking on the thumbnails.”  (personal communication, May 15, 2018)</blockquote>
<p>The above passages are intriguing because they shows that reviewers want something less “text-heavy” and more reflective of an interactive webpage with multimedia elements. However, text-heaviness is something many participants have significant training within print contexts; the multimedia elements, such as interactive graphs and high-resolution images cropped in Photoshop, are products of their independent learning and tinkering. And that learning has its own set of frustrations, according to several participants. Consider what Ian told me at DMAC when he discussed his experience learning the programming language Javascript, a programming language that runs underneath interactive graphs and many websites.</p> 

<blockquote>I remember three eight-hour days of_ just banging my head against the wall_, trying to get like a dot on top of a line. It wasn’t even my graph; I was just trying to make any graph to get the syntax, and I was like, ‘This is never going to happen’” (personal communication, May 15, 2018; emphasis added)</blockquote> 

<p>Ian and Nick spent weeks writing content and tinkering with the technical requirements of the webtext, and reviewers sent back requests that would require more time. Ian’s technical challenges and the reviewer feedback for his co-authored article indicate that negative feelings&mdash;such as those begat by banging one’s head against the wall&mdash;are in circulation with drafting and revision practices. Because of the substantial review process, digital media scholarship circulates between creators and reviewers multiple times before its public circulation. Within that lively (and lengthy) circulation, practices might be imbued with negative feelings that accumulate with each revision. In other words, when reviewers hate something, that feeling infects (flows into?) the new revision tasks ahead of authors. The cycle starts over and bad feelings accumulate.</p>  
<p>However, such negative feelings can be generative for webtext authors. A webtext isn’t dead. Grace, for example, said she was grateful for the feedback from two peers who were reviewed her webtext:</p>  
<blockquote>I really agreed with all the things that they said about it, and that’s not always the case. Sometimes you get feedback back from editors and you’re like, “Oh god, I don’t want to change that or do that thing that you’re suggesting.” It was kind of fun to go through and, like, take a machete to it. We changed a lot and they may very well ask us to make more changes too, but to see the growth has been really cool. (personal communication, June 7, 2018;emphasis added)</blockquote> 
<p>Furthermore, my research also indicated that feedback, while a negative experience for authors such as Brooke, became an exigency for seeking out collaborators. Without feeling awash in disappointment or frustration, in other words, scholars might not seek out collaborators in order to revise their productions. Re-consider Brooke’s case. For all the pain and negative feelings that were imbued within her project&mdash;which saw three rounds of reviewer feedback and revisions&mdash;she experienced considerable positive feelings when working with a mentor, an editor who was assigned to Brooke later in the process. They were introduced over email. Connecting over Skype and social media, the editor helped Brooke re-envision her design and recompose her paragraphs for the conventions of academic writing in digital environments. How does she sum up their relationship? “It wouldn’t be published if it weren’t for his help” (personal communication, February 5, 2018). The editor’s mentorship and helpful commentary on Brooke’s content were collaborative acts on which Brooke could rely for encouragement, a source of good feeling that helped her move the webtext project through to publication.</p>   
<p>These sentiments were echoed by Helen. She spoke of the support from her peers when her proposal for a print book was rejected by a publisher. Their encouragement to reframe the book into a video book was a catalyst for her revisions. </p>  
                                
    <blockquote>Rejections can be the biggest gift you’ll ever get, because a good rejection with good feedback on it can make for an incredible project somewhere else. So, I’m very, very thankful to whoever it was who rejected my book. (personal communication, March 13, 2018).</blockquote>
                                
<p>In sum, it’s unproductive to claim that bad feelings that circulate in living digital media are to be avoided at all costs. When creators feel bad about revision, they turn to existing support networks, whether they’re made visible collaborators/receive publication credit. And when revisions are complete, new feelings emerge and circulate.</p>
