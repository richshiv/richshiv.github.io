<h2>Feeling Revision: Stories of Livestreaming and Inviting Feedback in 2021</h2>
<p>[Video abstract in the opening]</p>
<p>[Video transcript]</p>
<p>At the start of this chapter, then, let’s go back to Michael McMaster’s story of creating <cite>Untitled Goose Game</cite> with his friends at their company House House. When the team was preparing for the game’s release, it sought out “playtesters,” reviewers who play various parts of a game and offer comments. Playtesting supports targeted revisions to a game. House House met in an office regularly for conducting playtests. McMaster speaks at length about relying on gamers in the Melbourne community for feedback during in-person playtesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MM 21: [In-person testing] is one of the clearest examples of the way that we were able to rely on our creative community. We knew a lot of people in Melbourne, we didn’t want to do any, or as little as possible, remote playtesting. All of our playtesting pretty much was done by people coming into our office, sitting down and us watching them play through the whole game, which we wanted to do just because it was more convenient for us and we could actually see in real time what they were getting stuck in and it wasn’t about collecting feedback from them after the fact. We could just talk stuff through with them there and then. But also it was very good that we could draw on this community of people who would be interested in the game and were “games literate” and “game development literate.” We could talk stuff through with them in a fairly in-depth way, although we’re also extremely conscious to also pull in as many players as we could who didn’t have that same literacy because we wanted the game to be accessible to a really broad kind of range of people ideally. This could be people’s first game, basically. We brought in as many kind of people who hadn’t played many games as we could as well. It’s not like it was two camps of hyper literate and completely illiterate. People across the whole spectrum, like lots of friends who we knew from outside of games, who we knew played games, but didn’t know anything about game development or anything." #soundcite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McMaster’s comments signal that inviting in and responding to feedback from myriad audiences can be quite beneficial for revising a game. This is the point I want to dwell on in Chapter Three.</p>
<p>It’s an understatement that revision is a love-hate practice of writing and composing. In Chapter One, a number of scholars note that revision, including reading feedback and responding to it, is one of the most painful practices in the production cycles of scholarly webtexts. For digital media creators in writing studies, feedback comes in multiple waves, it’s lengthy, it’s ripe with comments of praise, confusion, and otherwise constructive criticism and usually from more than two reviewers. Moreover, feedback comes after an initial submission, prompting creators to revise code, designs, and textual passages. Not everyone reading this chapter will agree that revising a webtext is more affective and time-intensive than an alphabetic article. Still, many of us who publish have experienced similar pains related to revision, especially if we’ve sunk a considerable amount of time and energy into an article or book project and are expected to wait several weeks or months for a letter from an editor along with reviewer comments.</p>
<p>So if the practice of revision is painful, what might we do in the field of writing studies to perhaps lessen that pain—or come at it and process it differently? While in-person playtesting has been a viable option for many game developers seeking out feedback for more effective revisions, it is not an approach I focus on in this chapter or recommend for writing studies scholars who are seeking feedback on digital works in progress. It often requires substanial time, funds, and space, and in-person and remote testing is rather akin to the traditional review process of scholarship. Instead, to answer the aforementioned question, I turn to stories of game developers who compose and revise digital media in real-time with remote communities on Twitch. Defined as livestreaming, this rhetorical-affective practice on Twitch animates intimate yet global interpersonal circulation because it requires the circulation of works in progress to online communities that offer feedback and support revision tasks. For creators such as game developers, livestreaming is a crucial practice for resolving revisions in temporally immediate ways well before a final publication.</p>
<p>When I was preparing this book in 2020 and 2021, we were—and perhaps still are—in the thick of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. The coronavirus relegated many of us to our homes, forcing us into isolation and behind computer screens more often than we probably would have liked. (And as someone who revels in in-person fieldwork, this was really challenging for my research. More on that in the “Ephemera” section of this chapter.) For disciplines such as writing studies, we were forced to work remotely, whether on research, teaching, or digital media production. We were pressed, that is, to present our work, our voices, and our bodies to remote communities in engaging ways.</p>
<p>Combined with my research concerning how scholarly creators find collaborators and handle feedback, the pandemic created exigencies for turning to game developers who livestream their productions. By livetreaming, I mean the practices of composing in real-time and engaging with public audiences on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. These practices are vulnerable acts for creators, potential subjected to harassment and spam (see, for example, London et. al’s discussions of women content creators). However, livestreaming practices establish more public, real-time communities of feedback that support revision. Scholars engaging in such practices might help increase the visibility of their work, cultivate affective encounters in real-time, and enrich their revisions to projects from its early stages to its final delivery. Such practices might be productive counter-acts to the long tail of academic publishing. As noted in Chapter One by scholars, months of composing digital media and then awaiting peer-reviewed feedback add gravity to feelings of impatience and uncertainty about revision.</p>
<p>The heart of Chapter Three pulses with stories of creators in game development who stream regularly on Twitch. Game developers such as Justin Amirkhani and Lana Lux have documented their work extensively on Twitch. I turn to their stories and others, discussing their practices and projects extensively and contextualizing them with commentary from a number of creators. As noted earlier in this book, ground-level research into these practitioner stories is a both/and approach to studying practices and feelings. From watching and participating in their livestreams of real-time composing, I was able to better address moments in livestreams that were affectively rich for creators, using those moments as talking points for interviews. Interviews, in other words, helped us arrive at a shared understanding of livestreaming as a rhetorical-affective practice.</p>
<p>But before I turn to creator stories, I return to theories of emotion that posit the emergent, circulatory nature of affective responses and feelings. Alexandria Peary, Laura Micciche, Zizi Papacharrisi are just a few whose work proves useful for theorizing Twitch as grounds for public, affectively charged feedback  and revision with audiences. Staying with the present moment, dwelling in economies of feeling, and recognizing the power of affective publics, are worth considering for digital media creators in writing studies. Without considering these practices, writing studies creators are missing opportunities to put their works in progress in circulation long before the final publication. This chapter details the strategies for taking on such opportunities.</p>
<p>After working through creator stories, Chapter Three ends with strategies for writing studies scholars who might be interested in livestreaming their digital media projects, as scholarly projects are virtually non-existent on Twitch. (This comment is not to suggest that scholars are totally absent from Twitch. Many game scholars, in fact, play and hold talks on the platform.) My discussion is based on my own experiences livestreaming for a series titled “100 Days of Writing” under the username and eponymous channel TheeRhetoric. The aim of the series was to integrate my research findings into my own practices, embodying, and thus testing, the practices and feelings expressed by a range of creators.</p>
