  <h3>Locating Affective Bodies in Collaborative Contexts</h3>
<blockquote>Despite the disorienting phenomena we experience when composing collaboratively in new modes, the convergence that results is ultimately productive. Collaborative multimodal composition is a valuable practice not only because of what it is capable of producing but also because of how it re-energizes concepts of audience, genre, and recursivity<br>&mdash;Molly Scanlon, “The Work of Comics Collaborations: Considerations of Multimodal Composition for Writing Scholarship and Pedagogy”</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you’ve heard these names. If you haven’t, check them out. Collaborative authorship is a frequent and widely accepted practice in writing studies and game development, as these recent books and games demonstrate. Ideas for collaborative articles and books stem from emails, informal conversations at conferences, connections on Twitter and other social media. Such stories are present in Chapter One, in which numerous creators spoke of mentors and collaborators who supported their projects. As I explain in Chapter One, collaboration involves talking out ideas and strategies with co-authors, seeking out peers and mentors, and assigning production practices to co-authors, all for the sake of resolving bad feelings about webtext production. The writing studies field is ripe with stories of scholars, students, and community members collaborating on projects. Similarly, game developers have written extensively about the incredible teamwork that it takes to get a project finished. I’ll get to some of those stories in a minute. Right now, still lingering in mind is what Ian and Nick told me about collaborating in shared space and time at a retreat for scholars working on webtexts.</p>
<blockquote>That was huge in terms of motivators and terms of affect and stuff like that. We were in an isolated place for two weeks….We had a lot of steam; we had a lot of energy; we were excited; we had access to <cite>Kairos</cite> editors to bounce questions off of.</blockquote>  #soundcite
<p>For a bit of refrain, this affective scene emphasizes what Kara Poe Alexander and Danielle Williams (2015) have called “distributed invention” that allows for “proximal composing,” the act of writing and collaborating near each other in shared space and time. It is such an apt term for recognizing the affective power of working together, especially when we can physically be together, our computers whirring at the same table, ideas brewing along with a second cup of coffee. Alexander and Williams’ writings about their proximal composing is one of many useful theories for understanding how feelings figure into collaborations. Affect theory is more than often not bound up with concerns of embodiment and the transient nature of feelings. Sometimes in the same breath as affect theory, rhetorical theories of collaboration have also been concerned with how bodies are affected when two or more people come together for a project. Margaret Syverson (1999) has argued that collaboration is dependent on relationships, which may or may not always be cooperative during a project. In <cite>The Wealth of Reality</cite>, an arguably under-referenced exploration of human-nonhuman ensembles in writing scenes, Syverson shares a transcript from a meeting between three students who are collaborating on an assignment. The meeting features students Rick, Annie, and Dana trying to write a first draft. It played out like this:</p>

	<blockquote>
    Annie: OK we’ll talk about lack of sleep, sickness, missing classes and then conflict between students...
    <br>
    Dana: OK, lack of sleep is one, two is sickness, three is&mdash;
    <br>
	Rick: So, lack of sleep first, huh...
    <br>
	Annie: Yeah, lack of sleep first.
      <br>
	Dana: OK.
          <br>
	Annie: We don't have a paragraph on this, though.
                 <br>
	Rick: Well now we need an intro into this...
                 <br>
	Dana: So, the high level of noise in the dorm&mdash;
                 <br>
	Annie: Is nearly impossible&mdash;
                 <br>
	Rick: Nearly impossible... We gotta make it sound real...bad... though.
                 <br>
	Annie: Real bad.
                 <br>
	Rick: I’m about ready to hang myself! [laughs] Just do something!
                 <br>
	Dana: OK, we're all into drugs&mdash;
                 <br>
	Annie: We're using sleeping pills...(p. 97)</blockquote> 

<p>Much of that scene took place by “a single computer, either in Rick’s dorm room or in Annie's, with one person inputting or changing text or reading back what had been written as the others made suggestions” (Syverson, p. 95). According to Syverson, the students “were determined to write the essay while in close physical proximity (when one member of the group had to be out of town, no one suggested that the group discuss the work by phone; instead they waited until they could all get together).” While that scene is more than 20 years old, it’s still relevant to more current theories of collaboration, such as Alexander and Williams’ aforementioned theory of proximal composing and Danielle Williams and Michael-John DePalma’s (2017) theory of “distributed collaboration,” and Laura Miccciche’s (2017) theory of “writing partners.” In a similar line of thought to the aforementioned scholars, Ashley Clayson (2018) argues that writing studies needs “to focus simultaneously on the material and embodied nature of writing by combining them under the umbrella term <i>distributed</i>” (p. 220), later arguing that “to better understand their agency, we must understand the [writers’] interactions with their immediate environments, not just larger, abstract structures” (p. 223).</p> 

<p>Clayson’s view calls attention to immediate environments that include fellow bodies and local resources. A writer’s interactions often include immediate collaboration, the kind we can see materialize in a physical, shared space. For Clay Spunuzzi (2015), this immediate collaboration is part of “coworking” in “all-edge adhoracies.” Coworking, he describes, “is a service in which most of the value comes not from providing the space itself but from connecting people who can help each other out” (p. 97). I have no qualms with this idea, which aligns well with Micciche’s view that writing partners are always present in scenes of writing&mdash;that even animals are crucial collaborators in the composing process. (And that reminds me: in the next Ephemera section, you can learn more about this book’s key collaborators, such as a black cat.) Cats, dogs, that pre-tenure colleague who started the same year you did&mdash;they all matter whether they are contributing text, image, or nothing at all in terms of what we see on the page. Micciche puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote>Writing is populated and partnered in ways that we can’t always recognize. An indiscreet art, writing is something we do with others, created through contact with and exposure to diverse influences and agents. The fabric on your favorite chair, the smell of the laundromat down the street, the light coming in through a window, the muffled voices half heard through floorboards, the cat on your lap&mdash;all of these partners make writing a thoroughly collaborative&mdash;COLLABORATIVE!&mdash;event. (p. 111)</blockquote> 
<p>For Micciche, even that bee who dive-bombs into my cup of coffee, is a collaborator, a reminder to look up and pay attention to the environmental surround that makes writing (im)possible. Micciche’s theory and others maintain that the writer never writers alone. Collaborators indeed challenge us to work with, between, and against material, affective forces in circulation (see Micciche, 2017; Rule, 2019).</p> 

<p>[Media to be placed&mdash;maybe the bee?]</p> 
<p>Game production studies drives this point about collaboration further. In <cite>The Developer’s Dilemma</cite>, Casey O’Donnell (2014) unpacks creative collaboration among large and small development teams of games. O’Donnell’s book is useful because, in great detail, it scopes out the commonplace roles of game developers. Engineers interact with artists, both of whom interact with designers who negotiate the former’s programming and stylings, all of which is later subject to many change requests and short deadlines that follow such requests. As O’Donnell posits, “this process, when under pressure can result in reckless cycling, or rapid changes that result in a more chaotic structure. The ability to “iterate” on a problem with a team is productive, but when that iterative structure is put under immense time pressure, it often begins to fall apart, rendering the resulting incessant iteration useless” (p. 133). While O’Donnell’s scope is outside of emotion studies, numerous stories in <cite>The Developer’s Dilemma</cite> are ripe with affectively rich practices and consequences, including in-person, ad-hoc discussions about problem solving. “The general unpredictability and instability of production systems” results in myriad scenes of tension between team members on deadline (p. 132). System failures and deadlines amount to what the gaming industry and O’Donnell call “crunch,” a strategy and condition in which “employees will stay late to make up the slack created by overwhelmed feedback loops, ineffective interactivity, interdisciplinary breakdowns, or disrespect of emergent forms of structure” (p. 134). Crunch turns studios into spawning pits of bad feelings, including resentment and angst toward development partners. O’Donnell calls out the dangerous assumption of crunch. “Put in the language of the videogame industry, if you crunch it is because you did something wrong. And if you object to crunching, you shouldn’t be in the game industry” (p. 151). While this embodied, negative feeling is a near omnipresent condition of the industry, a whole another chapter would need to be dedicated to it in order to make sense of it, and for most of my participants, it was a thing that happened at times but did not destroy a team or a project. Nevertheless, a takeaway from O’Donnell’s analysis is that collaboration is circulatory and affectively charged, for better or worse.</p> 

<p>So far in this part of Chapter Two, I’ve been discussing theories of collaboration that emphasize proximity and immediate interactions with peers and others, at times under deadlines. I’m going to complicate this discussion by turning to a collaborative project written by Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart, <cite>The Hundreds</cite>. The book is a collection of “theoretical poems,” 100-word meditations on everyday happenings, scenes of feelings in motion. In the book, Berlant and Stewart offered the following about collaboration: “Collaboration is a meeting of minds that don’t match. Circulation disturbs and creates what’s continuous, anchoring you enough in the scene to pull in other things as you go” (p. 28). That latter line&mdash;I read it as a comment on feelings that circulate between collaborators and objects, things, in scenes of collaboration. Better yet, the comment is apt for in-person and remote collaborations. In an interview about <cite>The Hundreds</cite>, Berlant said much of their collaborative writing was completed at a distance. She reflected on the “the great pleasure of editing together” (p. 291) with Stewart, a pleasure that extended between their workplaces in Chicago and Austin. As Berlant explains to Katarzyna Bojarska (2019):</p> 
<blockquote>…. Many of the pieces come from our long-term exchanges about things we had seen and experienced. We were talking on the phone, taking notes and transcribing, writing and rewriting, thinking ‘what have we learnt from this?’ Then we finally sat down to work on the book and to get as close as possible to our hooks. We share commitments but not the same sensitivities, sometimes. (p. 300)</blockquote> 
<p>By commitments, Berlant might be referring to commitments to writing and working together, a shared time when feelings can clash and shift during a production cycle&mdash;even if it’s done entirely remotely. Collaboration and affect need not be entirely moot if done remotely, as many of have come to understand all too well during the global pandemic. Given what the aforementioned scholars have said, it’s safe to say, however, that the writing studies field has paid less attention to remote collaboration. And it makes sense. The exigency for making visible and establishing those remote partners simply wasn’t there until the pandemic gripped our workplaces and practices.</p>

<p>If we turn again to game development, however, stories of remote collaboration and associated feelings come into full view. O’Donnell writes, for example, of India developers who struggled to collaborate with US-based developers via remote communication channels. “Teams of artists were being asked to produce art assets in a way that no traditional game developer would be asked to do. The inability to see how changes made to a particular art asset were then reflected in the games engine made it difficult for artists to understand the relationship between their work and the game in which it was being placed” (p. 118). For a 2021 perspective on students who developed games remotely for the Cologne Game Lab in Germany, André Czauderna and Emmanuel Guardiola (2021) write that students “were well aware that remote work requires additional attention and efforts when it comes to aspects such as time management, allocation of work, and mutual understanding” (p. 17). However, they warn of “unhappiness and psychological struggles for students/workers which might not only be to the detriment of their well-being, but also&mdash;in the long-run&mdash;their professional performance” (p. 17). These example suggest the spectrum of feelings that might surface in scenes of remote collaboration.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, scenes of collaboration narrated directly from game developers underscore such findings. In the gaming industry, game creators often write public post-mortems, or reflections on the successes and failures of a project. In our study of more than 75 post-mortem written by game developers, my collaborator Jessica Oliviera Da Silva and I found that developers spoke often of the challenges of remote communication&mdash;that is, working on and thus communicating production tasks remotely (you can read more about it in our 2021 article, “Sharing Pain and Pleasure”). As Balm et. al (2015) wrote about his team’s helicopter-based platformer game <cite>Heroki</cite>, much of the game’s production stage was communicated via Skype, which resulted in miscommunication. “From time to time, team members would be confused about certain gameplay elements because they had interpreted something in another way than it had been intended.” Balm added, “Toward the end of the project we were able to work from the same location more often, and during these times we found that we worked more efficiently. Working together made creating and testing builds a faster process and development sped up.”</p>

<p>For Balm and many others, bodies in proximity resulted in better production, better task management, better communication, and better feelings between team members. As Ted Morris wrote of working on the real-time strategy game <cite>Grey Goo</cite> in an open-office environment, “impromptu meetings sprang up to solve problems on the spot, everyone was on the same page about the components they were working on, windows were now a more widely available commodity and there seemed to be less of a reliance on email to get things done. There were, of course, a few transitional issues as well (like noise), but after everyone got used to their new environment, that regulated itself fairly well&mdash;or people started wearing headphones” (Morris, 2015). That comment stems from their post-mortem in 2015. Amid pandemic conditions in 2022, these feelings persist. Numerous news articles and reports about game development delays due to COVID-19 have shed light on embodied collaboration. In their “State of the Game Industry 2021” report, for example, organizers of the annual Game Developers Conference published the following comments from developers:</p> 
<blockquote>“We have lost months due to not being able to travel, work in person, and work together more collaboratively” (p. 18). 
<br>
“Connection to my team, work-life balance was much harder, working from home easily slid into 'living in the (home) office'. I have returned back to working in the office a couple months ago and felt like I got my life back” (p. 20).</blockquote> 
<p>Comments like these are echoed across too many recent articles to cite here. However, it’s important to call out that game development has a long history of in-person and remote collaboration and work in general. In our study of 246 game developers affected by COVID-19, Beth Caravella, Nanditha Narayanamoorthy, and I found that 96 of developers preferred working from home&mdash;many saying they already worked from home&mdash;and working in a hybrid model between home and an office. Developer comments were ripe with feelings about both in-person and remote collaboration.</p> 

<p>[Turn to an audio segment of Beth and I talking over the data, maybe reading a passage from our recent manuscript to CDQ]</p> #soundcite

<p>Along with my previous studies of scholarly authorship, the pandemic and aforementioned study were exigencies for discussing both proximal and remote collaborations in this chapter. To ignore our current pandemic conditions would fail to acknowledge the new and likely permanent calls for hybrid workplaces and collaborations.</p>
