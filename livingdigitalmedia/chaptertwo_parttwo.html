<p>Hi there, this is Rich Shivener, and you’re listening to Chapter Two, Part Two of Feeling Digital Media. This part is titled “Twitching in the Present Moment.”</p>
                                
<blockquote>In whatever form or focus, there is more call than ever to stay with emotion—whether in our personal lives, classrooms, writing, or political commitments. Staying with emotion is staying with others, for, without others, emotion has no meaning or effect. In that sense I see the power of emotion studies still in its ability to foreground how coalitions of people, of causes, of diverse others come together and/or break apart. ––Laura Micciche, 2016</blockquote>

<p>That was a quote from Laura Micciche, read by a colleague of mine.</p> 

<p>When I write, most of the time I do it alone. Most of 2020 and 2021 were spent in my home office in Toronto. I only turned to others when we scheduled writing group meet-ups on Zoom and occasionally on a Slack channel. Only recently did I start displaying my own work publicly on Twitch, the experiences of which I describe later in the chapter.</p> 

<p>Twitch is an incredible platform for content creators to show their work process in-situ, meaning they compose and chat about materials in real-time with publics. It started in 2011 and claims to have more than 7 million streamers each month. The service is operated by Amazon, which offers incentives to those who subscribe to the Amazon Prime delivery and distribution service. Twitch's creators and audiences mainly come out of gaming and game development but also include communities of comics creation, writing, and "just chatting" streams. In fact, United States of America President Joe Biden’s 2021 inauguration was live-streamed on Twitch, further cementing the service’s prowess for distributing public content to thousands of viewers with a diverse range of interests. Twitch, in a way, is a dream for writing studies because content creators are self-selecting methods familiar to process studies: talking aloud about draft material and sharing multiple drafts, even doing so for multiple sessions over months and even years. What’s more, Twitch creators often archive their work for audiences, meaning researchers have access to at least two weeks’ worth of on-demand content for review.</p> 

<p>There are myriad reasons why content creators stream on Twitch. Lisa Brown (2015; https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/259163/An_indiestyle_experiment_at_a_AAA_studio_Insomniacs_Slow_Down_Bull.php) reflects on  game studio Insomniac’s live-streaming practices for the development of its game Slow Down, Bull. Twitch was a matter of holding the team accountable while building an audience for the game. As Brown writes of the team’s weekly stream:</p>
    
<blockquote>It unified the team under a common weekly event (streaming yourself building the game is pretty stressful, so it bonded us together!) It also connected us with a curious audience of fans. [The reading of the block quote ends here.] Some of our favorite moments were letting our stream audience come up with names for the characters in the game, or meeting people at events like PAX who had been coming to the streams since the beginning, and who expressed how grateful they were for being shown “behind the curtain” of the development process.</blockquote>
                                
<p>You’ll hear from the creators I interviewed in a bit. Right now, I want to emphasize that Twitch is no stranger to social science and humanities researchers. Recent research has studied women content creators (London et al., 2019; Ruberg & Brewster, 2019; Ruberg, 2020), game-player streaming (Taylor, 2018; Johnson & Woodcock, 2019), and audiences/users of streams writ large (Sjöblom & Hamari, 2017; Kobs et al., 2020). As of writing this book, however, rhetoric and writing studies still has an opportunity to enter this rich body of scholarship more expansively, as do interdisciplinary scholars who study public affect. As a digital cultural movement, Twitch, that is, speaks to the field's areas such as process and practitioner studies (Rule, 2019; Lockridge and Van Ittersum, 2020), circulation and audience studies (Silvestro, 2019; Bradshaw, 2018; Riddick, 2019), and public affect (Gries, 2015[15]; Papacharissi, 2015). Twitch is a emergent confluence of creators, audiences, and feelings that circulate between them, all on public display. As Woodcock and Johnson (2019) argue, “it is the most gregarious, emotionally engaged, and outgoing individuals who find success in live streaming” on Twitch (p. 818, 2019[17]).</p> 

<p>In previous parts of this book, I have discussed a number of studies and theories under the large banner of affect. Here, I want to emphasize theories of emergent emotions and ways of sustaining them in public. Along with Woodcock and Johnson, Laura Micciche, Alexandria Peary and Zizi Papacharissi’s respective views serve me well here.</p>

<p>Composing on Twitch––or Twitching or live-streaming––is an act of staying with emotions in the present. To channel Laura Micciche (2016), I find that Twitch means “thinking of emotion as active, rather than reactive or already formed in advance of expression” …. “to stay with emotion as one would stay with a single thought or image while meditating. When we stay, what can we learn about moving forward? What details do we notice? Where does our attention gravitate? Do we achieve clarity of any kind?” When creators live stream on Twitch, they are indeed working actively with and through emotions while on screen. To keep your work—and body––on screen in public is to refuse the privacy of emotion, to talk aloud and let others notice the details of production that cultivate and shift feelings. It’s affective labour, as Woodcock and Johnson found in interviews with hundreds of streamers. As they write about Twitch, “Twitch affords new ways to mediate affective performance, allowing the audience to connect with facial expressions, voice, and immediate surroundings” (p. 816, 2019[18]). Audiences can see the ways in which creators attend to their practices and feelings, including how revisions help said creator achieve a kind of clarity with their project.</p> 

<p>Real-time composing with audiences on Twitch speaks to Alexandria Peary’s definitions of mind waves and weeds. Rooted in Buddhist thinking, Peary defines mind waves and weeds as metaphors for affective responses that surface while composing. As Peary writes, “A splash of dread, pleasure at a good-fitting word, or a few seconds of a daydream pertaining to verbal achievement are not affective responses a student can premeditate or import into the writing occasion.” In this light, creators who compose in real time and in public on Twitch might have a work plan before they start a live stream, but it’s more than fair to say that many don’t premeditate what happens in-situ during a stream session. In other words, creators can’t always anticipate the myriad mind waves that ebb and flow. They can’t anticipate mind waves like:</p>

<blockquote> irritation, envy, doubt, a pulse emitted by the connotation of a word or memory, the adrenaline flash of realizing that one is running out of time to finish [The reading of the block quote ends here.] … exhaustion, swoosh of pride, a sudden pain in one’s wrist, bolt of fear, strike of hunger or fog of low blood sugar, tug of guilt, a passing question about worth or purpose, any accumulated emotional build-perhaps from previous writing experiences, the prickle of self-criticism, the thrill of exceeding a word count, the satisfaction of hearing one’s rapid typing.</blockquote>

<p>The aforementioned mind waves that Peary describes in her book Prolific Moment are the affective experiences and sensations that audiences outside of Twitch often do not see, read or generally learn about until a project’s conclusion. Many mind waves have long subsided by then, meaning audiences and creators are less likely to convene over, say, flashes of confusion and wonder associated with a composing task. While it comes with risks of being more vulnerable, the practice of live-streaming those mind waves knocks down affective barriers between creators and audiences. Live-streaming helps further demystify the writing process––that the writer doesn’t write alone but rather amid a confluence of feelings and materialities.</p>

<p>Peary’s theory is useful for understanding the internal manifestations of feelings, but her theory elides the social dimensions of affect. In contrast to Peary, Zizi Papacharrisi has written extensively about “affective publics,” a term which describes publics that post and circulate messages that cultivate ambient streams of emotion on social media. Streams circulate and intensify in digital environments, moving indefinitely and at times pressing on rhetorical bodies for better or worse (see Shivener, 2020).  Intensification leads to what Papacharissi calls affective ambience, a kind of always-on flow of affect and emotions across social media like Twitter. As she writes, “[T]his ambience is essential in providing constant updates, even when not much is happening or other media are not covering the story” (p. 130). She suggests that such an ambience doesn’t go away when we turn off our screens; rather, affective texts and their publics continue moving, evolving, subsiding, and intensifying.</p> 

<p>Don’t get me wrong. When I write, I find it safer to keep those mind waves to myself and close off affective publics. When I live-streamed workshops for one of my digital writing courses in Fall 2020, I experienced a range of mind waves. I shared my screen, I kept my webcam and mic on, and applied rhetorical definitions and strategies to digital projects. I had my fair share of hiccups (both real and technical), moments of hesitation and stuttering, and confusing glitches, interchanged with celebrations and self-deprecation. Sure, it was a performance with an agenda (e.g., the lesson plan), but the sessions weren’t premeditated beyond that. After each session, I returned to the on-demand recording, noticing my ways of speaking, staying on task, meandering, etc. Live-streaming held me more accountable for getting work done and doing so effectively.</p> 

<p>[Audio cuts to some excerpts from the live stream]</p>

    <p>Mind you that these mind waves are commonplace when I teach online or in-person. I suspect many of us in writing studies would agree about their teaching––pandemic or no. I’m suggesting more of us try displaying those mind waves in public when we work on our digital media productions and various writing projects. What’s at stake when those mind waves, including the rhetorics and affects that accumulate with them, when we work amid affective publics? To shed light on that question, I move us to part three of this chapter, a focus on stories of creators I spoke with for this project.</p>
