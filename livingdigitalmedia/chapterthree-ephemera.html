<p><i>Each chapter of <cite>Living Digital Media</cite> includes behind-the-materials that I made or saved while composing this project and the chapter. Journal entries, audio outtakes, snippets of code, conversations—I call these ephemera because they’re materials that are often discarded or abandoned when I move closer to a final publication. Feeling Digital Media’s "Ephemera” sections, however, work against my tendencies to discard project materials over time. Waste not. Some materials were made in anticipation of this section, while others simply surfaced when I was composing. Nevertheless, I hope it’s useful for anyone who does or is interested in this doing digital work.</i></p>
<p>Ephemera, Chapter Three focuses the pain and pleasure of interviewing participants and revising parts of the book.</p>
<section id="participants" class="section scrollspy">
<h3>Generous Participants</h3>
<p>I want to be totally honest: creators have been so generous with their time speaking to me about their books, comics, and games—often for little to no pay. Interviews can be exhausting for all parties involved, from the scheduling to the interview itself, to the follow-up afterwards. Qualitative research demands that exhaustion in service of ethics. That said, Chapter Two was largely composed remotely and with remote interviews and methods. It took a considerable amount of time to make that happen, as opposed to taking a person-on-the-street approach at, say, the annual Rhetoric Society of America Conference or the Game Developers Conference, held annually in San Francisco. Also, even if a creator had refused compensation for doing an interview, I still tried to reciprocate in some way, and not just by telling their story in this book. In some cases, I played their games and left reviews, and I was asked to simply spread the word about their work on social media, to students, and fellow researchers. As suggested in the introduction to this book, this method reflected that of Ridolfo’s "practitioner stories.” Speaking of interviewing activists about their delivery practices, Ridolfo (2012) argued "we cannot rely on merely studying the location of texts at different points in time (movement and speed) as a means to understand delivery in the twenty-first century” (p. 127). My translation: ground-level research is a slower but fulfilling method for understanding the rhetorical-affective practices of creators, as told by those creators.</p>

<section id="audio" class="section scrollspy">
<h3>Audio Fails</h3>
<p>Inevitability, interview recordings can and will fail when doing qualitative research. Once when I was interviewing a scholar in 2018, I recorded the entire interview with Quicktime and Skype failed to enable my built-in microphone to capture the audio. The result was a silent conversation about digital composing. Perhaps a lip sync is in order.</p>
<p>[Include video from that silent interview]</p>
<p>Later, I was using a better microphone and recording the audio from my computer speakers. The only challenge was that the microphone picked up too much ambience in the room. The mic also had a tendency to pick up its own hum, which is a pain in post-production because you lose some quality to the sound.</p>
<p>[Cut to an example of audio.]</p>
<p>By 2020, I had developed a number of tools and practices that prevented similar errors in audio recording. Skype had enabled audio capturing, and Zoom had a feature for capturing and rendering two or more participants’ audio feeds. This feature is nice because you can mix the tracks in post-production, especially if a participant’s audio feed is quiet.</p>
<p>Still, Zoom has its faults. In one case, for a digital article, a research assistant and I recorded two, one-hour long conversations about a research project. After recording the second hour, we realized that Zoom automatically overwrites prior recordings in the same folder, without warning. That meant we lost the first hour. It’s a mundane thing to point out, but these little fails add up and often go unacknowledged in the final product of a publication.</p>
</section>
<section id="preparation" class="section scrollspy">
<h3>Preparation Fail</h3>
<p>In the early stages of this research, I got burned during an interview. And it was no fault but my own. I was interviewing a developer about his experimental game, but before the interview, I didn’t carve out time to play the game. He noticed, and he called me out. Here is my stumbling during that interview.</p>
<p>[Place transcript here.]</p>
<p>This research failed reminded me a lot of Luke Burbank’s interview with Icelandic band Sigur Ros for NPR’s <cite>Bryant Park</cite> Project. The 2007 interview made headlines, <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15314775">even a retrospective on NPR</a>, for being one of the worst interviews with musicians in media history. The interview highlights the push and pull of doing interviews with creators—they have to want to be there, and you have to value their time by showing up prepared by reading prior interviews, playing their media, etc. Burbank and I, you could say, had some homework to do.</p>
<p>Despite some hiccups that happen in the research process, failure can be funny in hindsight, and perhaps even a talking point during an interview. The developer and I left on good terms, and his suggestions for how to prepare ahead of time when speaking with game developers definitely helped me as I conducted more. I did have this to say in a reflection just after we spoke.</p>

<h3>A Revision Toward More Storytelling</h3>
<p>In summer 2021, I was at a bit of a standstill with this chapter. I had the topic on lock, but I felt the content was lacking some life, some stories of creators. This is a short clip of a conversation I had with a colleague about the approach. Conversations like these were the lifeblood for completing the book.</p>

<h3>Highlight Video from 100 Days of Writing: Livestreaming My Reading of Reviewer Letters</h3>
<p>Finally, this "Ephemera” part of Chapter Three ends with a highlight reel from my streams on Twitch called 100 Days of Writing. Feel free to check the full archive of the series on YouTube. Responding to my own call for showing our revision work, this final video highlights my reading and response to the reviewers of my first submission to the press. In this video, I read through the document and compile it into a checklist, also displaying parts of the book’s design.</p>
<p>[Place this and transcript—keep it at no more than five minutes]</p>
