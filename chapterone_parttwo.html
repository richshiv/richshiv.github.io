<h3>Collaboration: Embodied Intensities</h3>                                

 <p>Collaboration is a practice that several authors framed as imbued with good feelings. According to participants, collaboration involves talking out ideas and strategies with coauthors, seeking out peers and mentors, and assigning practices to coauthors. Collaboration is a kind of concurrent practice that touches many practices of a digital media production cycle, especially supporting invention and revision based on reviewer feedback. Consider what participant Kris said in their questionnaire response when discussing a webtext coauthored with three scholars. Together they “wrote the intro, lit. review, and conclusion and edited the entire piece. However, (Kris) wrote the aural section, (one coauthor) wrote the tactile section, and (another coauthor) wrote the visual section. (A third coauthor) edited and did the web design.” Kris’ commentary underscores the idea that many webtexts are highly collaborative. According to several authors who were living digital media, collaboration-as-practice was a constant source of pleasure, a counteragent to the pains of working with code and revising the entire webtext in response to lengthy reviewer feedback. (See the next section for a discussion on reviewer feedback.) Collaboration is a means to dividing rhetorical and affective labour.</p>

<p>What is most surprising about collaboration is that it is often hidden within the final publication of a webtext in a footnote or brief acknowledgment. Many webtexts I examined do not feature acknowledgements, which, as Micciche (2017) argues, often reveal partners involved in composing practices and felt experiences (p. 4). Yet my research shows that many authors couldn’t complete a webtext without some form of collaboration, even if a webtext was listed as created by a single author. Henry relied on research assistants to convert his Word documents into webpages, whereas two senior scholars asked Lane to transform their commentary into a webtext. Emily hired two data visualization and coding experts in the field to help her design a webtext and compose interactive maps. Similarly, Helen employed her partner and several students when she was filming for her digital book. As she told me in an interview,  “I love collaborating. It’s very hard to make films without help. . . . I hire people who I know are kind and helpful, and I try to be kind and helpful in return” (personal communication, March 13, 2018). Helen also spoke of mentoring undergraduates: “I love collaborating with undergraduate students. It requires a level of mentorship on one’s part. But they also bring such energy and such amazingness. And then you can also put that on your merit review as part of your teaching.” </p> 
<p>For Helen, this undergraduate focus is vertical mentorship, a collaborative act that several authors spoke of. While drafting a webtext, for example, Ian and Nick attended KairosCamp, a two-week bootcamp for scholars interested in learning webtext production practices, taught by editors of <cite>Kairos</cite>. KairosCamp is like DMAC insofar as both scholarly institutes assume that authors will learn and grow in a community of digital media producers (see KairosCamp’s “Author Workshop Archive” and DMAC’s “SCHEDULE” for overviews). Reviewer feedback for Ian and Nick’s webtext came in while they were attending KairosCamp. The timing was fortuitous, they said, as the two were surrounded by <cite>Kairos</cite> editors and peers with similar interests. Their proximity to editors, Ian and Nick told me, made their significant revision practices less painful. Nick described his KairosCamp experience this way:</p> 
<p>[Media to be placed] [Integrated video here with commentary]</p> 
                                
<blockquote>That was huge in terms of motivators and terms of affect and stuff like that. We were in an isolated place for two weeks. We had an idea of an agenda related to the webtext when we got there and it was still related to this project, but when we got there we got feedback about this article, and so we kind of diverged course and decided to just tackle these revisions head-on. <i>We had a lot of steam; we had a lot of energy; we were excited</i>; we had access to Kairos editors to bounce questions off of. (personal communication, May 15, 2018; emphasis added)</blockquote> 
                                
<p>In response to reviewer feedback and editorial support at KairosCamp, Ian and Nick produced a video-based literature review and integrated it into the second draft of their webtext.</p>  
<p>Their commentary and outcomes suggest that lively bodies in proximity, in shared time and space dedicated to digital media production, can be noticeably positive. Kara Poe Alexander and Danielle Williams (2015) call such a practice “proximal composing” under the process of distributed invention, or DI. Inventing with collaborators in proximity means “being aware of fellow composers in a material space and their potential influence on projects composed in that space. . . . Also, being willing to engage with and support oth- ers is another valuable element” (p. 35). Projects that come alive in a lively, supportive format allow good feelings to circulate between co-authors and peers.</p>  
<p>The relationship between proximal collaboration and positive affect was even more apparent from my interview with one senior scholar, Alex, who traveled across the country to compose a digital book with a frequent coauthor. As Alex explained with some laughter, “Many of these (digital composing) things you can do from a distance, but it is helpful to have some face-to-face contact. It’s just more fun when you can actually share a bottle of wine.” He emphasizes proximity, of being with others to get digital work done:</p>  
                                
        <blockquote>What I don’t want to let go of is the sense that actually physically being with other people is another way of knowing and . . . while I’m in love with many digital forms of communication and technologies, I’m also in love with actually being in the same room with people and exchanging ideas and sharing and thinking about bodily cues (personal communication, February 23, 2018).</blockquote>
                                
<p>A fair response to Ian’s and Alex’s reflections is that proximal collaboration on webtexts isn’t common in our field. We generally aren’t writing and designing webtexts&mdash;not to mention print articles&mdash;together unless we’re at institutes, camps, or conferences. Well before the COVID-19 pandemic, which relegated many of us to our homes, co-authors of digital media scholarship were working across institutions, time zones, and myriad borders. Even in contexts of remote collaboration, though, good feelings persist. Working across two time zones, Eric and Grace define their remote collaborations with co-authors and peers as “horizontal mentorship.”</p> 
 <p>When drafting their webtext, Eric and Grace were uncertain about what <cite>Computers and Composition Online</cite>editors were looking for in terms of design. They recalled that the editors were open to design possibilities, pointing to the general guidelines for <cite>Computers and Composition Online</cite> (“Submission Guidelines”). Grace felt like she needed more direction from the editors. “I felt like I was doing something wrong or that we were going to get to the end of this and there was going to be some major disaster or something, so that was kind of scary, I guess” (personal communication, June 7, 2018). Fortunately, Grace’s fear was quelled when she and Eric found support through peers who had published webtexts. In our interview, Eric had more to say about one peer to whom he is indebted. He called a peer who recently published a webtext, asking about design choices and coding strategies: “I had really basic and what I perceived to be dumb questions and she was like, ‘No, that’s not a dumb question. Here’s what I did.’ If I didn’t have that (mentorship) from the start, we wouldn’t have been able to finish the project” (personal communication, June 7, 2018).</p>  
<p>Put differently, Eric’s newfound knowledge helped Eric and Grace divide the labor behind their webtext, writing in Google Docs and sharing prototypes over GitHub; Grace could focus more on content writing, while Eric could take charge of coding and designing the webtext in HTML5. Eric’s commentary on horizontal mentorship calls attention to peer-to-peer supports that made the publication of several webtexts possible. Emily was indebted to her collaborators, who indeed taught her basics of data visualization and helped her feel more confident about the claims of her argument. 

<blockquote>“QUOTE” (personal communication, March 15, 2018).</blockquote>  

<p>Among other participants who spoke of mentorship, graduate student Ryan collaborated with faculty as well as five peers on a webtext: “Each of us created our own depiction of our multimodal composing processes, and also offered feedback on each other’s work during the composing stage,” he wrote. He added that “most of what I learned throughout the project had more to do with collaboration and working with other people than with digital technologies” (personal communication, February 14, 2018).</p> 
                                
<p>It’s quite surprising how various forms of collaboration&mdash;whether in the same room or at a distance over the web&mdash;helped many participants positive feelings around a project, and that collaboration was a motivator to work through bad feelings that might be associated with drafting and revising digital media. Collaboration was a solution to resolving difficult composing practices, from anxieties about using HTML5, to uncertainties of how to visualize data. For scholars who decide to co-author a text, maybe collaboration keeps bad feelings at bay early on in the composing process. This isn’t to say that collaboration will always yield good feelings, for collaboration means the involvement of more ideas and possibly more conflicting goals.[1] My research might reflect an exigency for another study on failed collaboration in digital media scholarship.</p>
