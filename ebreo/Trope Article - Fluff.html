									<p>Fluff is a term used in writing to describe unnecessary details. They’re filler, meant to “fluff up” a passage to make it seem longer. They’re details like what kind of books are on a bookshelf, a conversation between two characters not immediately relevant to the plot, the exact path one walks to get to the grocery store, the precise and painstaking details about how good maple syrup is on pancakes. These things can be relevant to the story given the right context, but for the most part, they aren’t there for much other than to fill a page count. Understandably, writers are often discouraged from Fluff.</p>
									
									<p>But fanfiction writers have looked at this term Fluff and have decided to turn it into its own genre. All those unnecessary details are congealed together to form a story, even ones about the most innocuous scenarios, like having a cup of coffee or taking a nap or reading the book covers on a bookshelf. </p>
									
									<p>Fluff stories are present in every single fandom. And they’re incredibly popular. On the fanfiction website Archive of Our Own, the Fluff content tag is almost universally one of the top tags with the most stories in any given Fandom category. <i>Sherlock, RWBY, Star Trek, Star Wars, Fairy Tail, Teen Wolf, Supernatural, Harry Potter,</i> the entire DC Comics Universe, all of these properties have fandoms that list Fluff as their most popular content tag. People just seem to love to read and write Fluff.</p>
									
									<p>One would expect such stories that discuss such inconsequential topics like a coffee stain on a table to be short, and while many of them are, some of these stories can be upwards of tens of thousands of words long. </p>
									
									<p>But how can you extend such seemingly unnecessary details to be that long?</p>
									
									<p>Well, to understand that, we need to actually understand a few more things about Fluff Fanfictions. </p>
									
									<p>Fluff fanfictions are almost exclusively centred around a Ship. As noted in our “Topics of Interest,” Ships are romantic relationships pairings made by fans between two or more characters. </p>
									
									<p>For the sake of this argument, let’s look at the Bumblebee ship from the animated series <i>RWBY</i>, which is the romantic pairing of Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long.</p>
									
									<p>When you look through the many Fluff fanfictions centring around the Bumblebee Ship, you come to realize that stories that are noted to have “lots of Fluff” include many intimate moments between the central relationship. People in a relationship having a cup of coffee together, staying in bed with their significant other, going to the movies, playing video games, etc. These scenes tend to be long and incredibly detailed, but given the context, a Fanfiction that focuses on a Ship, it doesn’t seem unnecessary.  </p>
									
									<p>So, if the Fluff in Fluff fanfiction is not unnecessary, why is it still called Fluff?</p>
									
									<p>Well, these scenes of intimacy don’t actually contribute to the overall plot of the fanfiction, if there is one. If there is an outside conflict in the story, like an archenemy or supernatural force, these scenes of intimacy, the Fluff, are not usually relevant to that conflict. But in a story where Fluff is the entire point of the story doesn’t usually have a conflict. </p>
									
									<p>Let’s look at two Bumblebee Fanfiction, <i>Who Could Ever Love A Beast?</i> by DorkyBlueFish and <i>Warm as Sunrays</i> by BlackCats.</p>
									
									<p>In <i>Who Could Ever Love A Beast?</i>, the conflict and story are very similar to the movie <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, with Blake making a deal to stay with Yang, who has been cursed and turned into a monster. The conflict of the story then is the curse itself, but while a romance will of course have scenes of intimacy, the sheer volume of these scenes is what makes this story a Fluff fanfiction. These scenes can have a place, yes, but the sheer volume of it can make the story seem bloated and unnecessary. </p>
									
									<p><i>Warm as Sunrays</i>, on the other hand, features no such conflict, at least not to the degree of <i>Who Could Ever Love A Beast?</i>. Instead, <i>Warm as Sunrays</i> is about Yang trying to get Blake outside because the weather is nice outside today. The story for the most part doesn’t have much happen other than some very intimate and detailed scenes, but that’s the point, so the Fluff here is very necessary.</p>
									
									<p>But if it’s necessary, how is it Fluff? From this, we can understand that Fluff by fandom and fanfiction terms is not based on necessity. Throughout this article, we’ve discussed Fluff as scenes of intimacy while focusing on whether or not such scenes are necessary. But Fluff seems to be much broader than that. </p>
									
									<p>As these intimate scenes are necessary, it’s as if the intimate scenes alone are the Fluff.</p>
									
									<p>Having cute intimate scenes for the sake of cute and intimate scenes can seem self-indulgent, but that too is also the point of Fluff. Fluff as self-indulgent. That’s not a bad thing.</p>
									
									<p>By looking at Fluff, we can understand how fandoms often change the way commonly understood writing terms are used. To fanwriters, Fluff is not just the unnecessary backfill to fill up a page count. To fanwriters, Fluff is just a cute scene between romantic partners.</p>
									
									<p>But as the number of fanwriters greatly outweigh the number of professional writers and authors, could you say that the term Fluff and its meaning has simply changed amongst the general writing discourse? Has Fluff just stopped meaning filler and changed to meaning cute intimate content? I would say so.</p>
