									<p>Audience. Who are we creating content for? This has been my primary authoring concern for a long time. While you should always create and publish content that you, the author, are proud of, I think its important to recognize and get to know who we’re authoring content for. My own experiences with digital authoring have exposed me to a wide variety of different audiences. </p>

									<p>Hallo, I’m Jonell Ebreo, and in this essay, I’m going to go over my experiences with Digital audiences. </p>

									<p><b>(Pause in Music)</b></p>

									<p>Okay, first, let’s go back a bit. </p>

									<p><b>(VHS Rewind Sound Effect)</b></p>

									<p>Back in 2015, I… really liked Anime. </p>

									<p><b>(Music Resumes)</b></p>

									<p>I liked anime so much that I was elected President of my High School’s Anime Club. One of my duties as club president was to organize a digital platform that would post club announcements and just curate fun digital posts for everybody. I created a Facebook page for the club that allowed me to digitally engage and connect with other members.</p>

									<p>This was the first time I had created Digital content meant for anyone other than myself. An audience, one could say, and one that I knew quite intimately just as they knew me. It’s a moment that helped inspire me to do digital work similar to it in the years to come. However, I quickly found that those experiences I had with my anime club didn’t represent a vast majority of experiences other people had with Digital Authoring. </p>

									<p>As a big fan of stories and fanfiction, I eventually began writing my own stories for Fanfiction sites like Fanfiction.net and Archive of Our Own. However, unlike with my Anime Club page, I didn’t know anybody who read the content I produced. This isn’t to say that they were all strangers, I communicated and shared ideas with many people on those sites, but most people who read my stories didn’t know anything about me. </p>

									<p>Thankfully, my experiences as a storywriter and occasional editor led me to really connect with my core audience. People on those websites wanted to read fanfiction, so I wrote fanfiction. I got to meet and share interests with lots of new people.</p>

									<p>Unfortunately, not all my experiences with Digital authoring have been this positive. </p>

									<p><b>(Pause in Music)</b></p>

									<p>Some were just failures.</p>

									<p><b>(Tape Scratch Sound Effect)</b></p>

									<p>Yeah, some digital platforms just don’t have the resources your going to be looking for. I learned that the hard way.</p>

									<p><b>(Music Resumes)</b></p>

									<p>When I decided to start posting fanfiction and stories on Deviantart, a website more widely known for visual art, the audience I was publishing for simply wasn’t there. People on Deviantart, at least for the most part, weren’t there to read stories but to look at art. It was like people coming to an art gallery only for me to hand them a 2-inch thick book. </p>

									<p><b>(Pause in Music)</b></p>

									<p>What I was offering was out of place on that platform, so my page got very little traction. </p>

									<p><b>(Music Resumes)</b></p>

									<p>I did learn a valuable lesson though: learn where your audience frequents.</p>

									<p>You know, sometimes I need to think about and remember what I would expect as an audience member, as creators curate what content I like and where I frequent. I still got to Fanfiction.net and read Fanfiction and go to Deviantart to look at art.</p>

									<p>Since my time on Deviantart, I’ve been trying to learn new ways to reach out to different audiences. Trying to find different demographics, what certain audiences like, who I want my audience to be. I’ve learned a lot, and hopefully one day, I can find an audience that not only I can connect with but can connect with me.</p>
