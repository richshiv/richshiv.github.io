									<p><i>My Little Pony</i> is a cute little show about cute little ponies doing cute little things. Okay, it's not just about that, the world actually has some incredibly compelling characters, an expansive lore, and regularly presents deep and insightful themes. The surprisingly contemporary themes of <i>My Little Pony</i> have resonated with child and adult viewers alike, eventually spawning the infamous Brony fandom, made up of <i>My Little Pony</i>’s viewership.</p>
									
									<p>The Brony community has long been a fandom that has attempted to present itself as a family-friendly space (though it has repeatedly proven to not be such a thing).</p>
									
									<p>Prevalent discourse about the show often centres around the themes and lessons the show teaches, and the show itself has long been a happy, fun, and friendly show to watch. It’s a show about friendship, forgiveness, and love. Despite its prominent adult fanbase, <i>My Little Pony</i> is very much a children’s cartoon.</p>

									<p>But if you were to ever bring up the word “Cupcakes” to any Brony or <i>My Little Pony</i> fan, there’s a likely chance that they’re going to reel back and tell you to never say that word again. Thus is the power of <i>Cupcakes</i> on general Brony community discourse.</p>
									
									<p><i>Cupcakes</i> is a <i>My Little Pony</i> horror fanfiction written Drecker Jones, AKA Sergeant Sprinkles, around the time the Brony fandom was originally founded. As a horror fanfiction, it is obviously a major juxtaposition from the normally happy and cheery show.</p>

									<p>But <i>Cupcakes</i> is far from the first horror <i>My Little Pony</i> fanfiction and it is far from the last. In fact, horror and gore stories are so prevalent they’ve become their own category amongst Brony discourse. So what makes Bronies react so vehemently whenever they hear the word “Cupcakes?”</p>

									<p>It seems to come down to two factors: 1. <i>Cupcakes</i> is quite simply a brilliant horror story. 2. It was the first horror story with that kind of quality to be produced and shared in the Brony fandom.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Cupcakes Pinkie Pie (1).jpg" alt="" width="auto" height="auto" /></span>For the first point, it's important to give a brief overview of <i>Cupcakes</i> as a story. Told from the perspective of Rainbow Dash, one of <i>My Little Pony</i>’s main characters, she is invited by fellow protagonist and resident baker Pinkie Pie to taste some cupcakes at her bakery.</p>

									<p>In reality, however, Pinkie Pie tricks Rainbow Dash and drugs her, knocking her unconscious. When Rainbow Dash wakes up, she is tied up in a dark cellar, and Pinkie Pie reveals that her cupcakes are missing a single important ingredient: Rainbow Dash herself. Pinkie Pie then proceeds to torture Rainbow Dash to death and bake her into cupcakes, all while wearing a dress made out of other ponies’ skin.</p>

									<p>Now, you’re probably thinking right now, “That’s messed.” And yeah, that’s how the Brony reacted and still reacts to <i>Cupcakes</i>. The juxtaposition between the <i>My Little Pony</i> TV show and the <i>Cupcakes</i> fanfiction is very clear and escalates almost as quickly as I described it did. And the original story, for its time, was incredibly shocking, especially considering that Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie were two of the most beloved characters in the fandom, and Pinkie Pie especially was considered the most innocuous and family-friendly character in the show.</p>

									<p>The way the story describes the process of Pinkie Pie torturing Rainbow Dash is incredibly spine chilling, slowly describing Pinkie Pie’s knife cutting into Rainbow Dash’s skin and you can almost feel a crunch Rainbow Dash’s wings are torn off. This isn’t a dark or grotesque story for the sake of being dark and grotesque, it's true, genuine, cheek-scratching horror.</p>

									<p>But what hammers it all home is Pinkie Pie’s character isn’t really change in this fanfiction. She’s still laughing gleefully as she drives nails through Rainbow Dash’s hooves as if she’s hanging up a piñata. Pinkie Pie remains her naturally bubbly and cheerful self and treats the whole ordeal like another party, as Rainbow Dash pleads for her life. And that’s absolutely terrifying!</p>

									<p>Unfortunately, that’s where I move onto my second point, as it's because of that brilliant storytelling that this story has become as infamous as it has.</p>

									<p>The origin of the Brony fandom can be traced back to 4Chan forum boards, which was the main way Bronies communicated with each other in the early days of the fandom. <i>Cupcakes</i> was originally posted onto one of these boards. The shocking nature of the story, its overall quality, and the ease at which Bronies communicated on 4Chan made the story spread like wildfire.</p>

									<p>Since then, as good as the story was, its shocking juxtaposition between the cheerful and happy <i>My Little Pony</i> world and the sinister and twisted <i>Cupcakes</i> world gave it infamy yet seen that early in the Brony community. <i>Cupcakes</i> even has its own TV Tropes page. Almost 10 years later, the work remains as influential as it ever was, with almost every dark or horrifying fanwork credited to be influenced by <i>Cupcakes</i>.</p>

									<p>Author Sergeant Sprinkles has briefly commented on the surprising influence of <i>Cupcakes</i>, saying that he’s unsure how he feels about his story becoming the infamous thing in the fandom. But as he said, the story grew its own legs and ran off into the world without him, the story remains a life of its own. And through its infamy has permanently embedded itself into the language and history of the Brony Fandom.</p>
