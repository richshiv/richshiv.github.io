	(Screenshot of first slide of the presentation on the Keynote app) Prior to my talk with BIAPH, I practiced giving the presentation while having the PowerPoint presentation (picture of me working on my iPad) open on my iPad. I would practice voice intonation (screenshot of slide with pictures of me before the accident), memorization and transitions (picture of me working on my iPad). To help make my talk effective, I plan out the perfect (screenshot of slide with pictures of the accident and me on life support) timing and word choice to change the slides on the PowerPoint (screenshot of slide with a picture of me standing with my therapist) presentation. This makes for a smooth and easy to follow (picture of me working on my iPad) talk while maximizing the effects of the visuals (screenshot of slide with a picture of my graduation from Sheridan College) from the PowerPoint and (screenshot of slide with a picture of me giving a live presentation) audio from my words.<p>
 <p>(Piano tone changes)<p>
	<p>(Picture of the poster for the talk with BIAPH) On the day of the actual talk, I used the link sent to me by the host to join the Zoom meeting (screenshot of Zoom with my personal ID and link) 15 minutes before the start time. I joined early to make sure everything for the presentation was working properly. (Screenshot of Zoom meeting room) In order for me to use my PowerPoint presentation though, I needed the host to make me a cohost to allow me to share my screen. (Screenshot of Zoom meeting participants) Unfortunately, the host was not able to make me a cohost, and I could not upload (screenshot of the Zoom app with host options up) the PowerPoint directly to the Zoom meeting or email the presentation to the host because (screenshot of the Zoom app with more options up) of the video in the PowerPoint requiring the host to have the video file on their computer.<p>
	<p>(Video clip of one of my talks over Zoom) Luckily, since I memorized the words I have to say prior to the presentation, I opted to give the talk without the PowerPoint. (Piano stops) (applause sound effect starts) It was still a good talk, and I received phenomenal feedback, but  (picture of me giving a live talk) the PowerPoint not being available took away from the effects the pictures and video could of had on the audience. (Applause stops)</p>
