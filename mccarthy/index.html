								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Raised in small town Ontario I turned to writing to live in a world of my own. What started as escapism has lead to my pursuit towards a Bachelors of Arts Degree in English and Professional writing at York University.</p>
								<p>Leading into my 4th and final year at York I have my sights set on journalism and article based writing but the set of skills I have acquired through my time in school have set me up for success in virtually an writing platform.</p>
                <p>I am well versed in creative and professional writing, along with design both on and off the page.</p>
								<p>I have a deep passion for poetry and always find a way to see the beauty in everything. I have an eye or detail and a way with words.</p>

								<p>Transcript:</p>
								<p>I’m sure we’ve all heard those gen x boomer memes about young people being addicted to their phones and internet culture in general. And well, it looks like I’m a stereotype. My name’s Katlyn and I’m a writer, or more specifically a digital writer. Ijust turned 21 so I’m a little over 2 decades old, yet I have spent half of my time alive online contributing my writing and ideas to various platforms.</p>
								<p>If you think of a form of writing there’s a good chance I’ve taken a crack at writing it. I started on a small writing website posting cringe worthy romance stories, then slowly advanced to social media posting, and blogging on Tumblr, then running my own blog, and then created my pride and joy. My first born. My website courtlandstreet.</p>
								<p>Courtlandstreet was the result of digitizing my writing. For once I took a break from cyber writing and challenged myself to make something physical and distribute the final product, which happened to be a poetry zine I titled Algae Bloom. When Algae Bloom was finally finished production, my city was in peak lockdown, meaning I had to start from square one on how to distribute my work.  That’s where my website came in. Thanks to my prior knowledge and everything I’ve learned from years and years of digital writing and online design, I was able to create a space for my writingthat didn’t take away from it being digitized but instead enhanced my work.</p>
								<p>I started a little rough by scanning my pages and slapping them on a website just toget them out there, then hated that and started from the beginning and created PNGs of all my pages to properly showcase my poetry in a more sleek professional way.</p>
								<p>If it hadn’t been for my history of writing online I'm sure I would’ve given up. But I’mproud to be a stereotype, and I’m proud of my writing.</p>
								<p>Over the years I have learned to adapt, overcome, and advance. And that’s exactly what I did with my website, and that’s exactly what I’ll keep doing.</p>

								<p>Transcript:</p>
								<p>I’m sure we’ve all heard those gen x boomer memes about young people being addicted to their phones and internet culture in general. And well, it looks like I’m a stereotype. My name’s Katlyn and I’m a writer, or more specifically a digital writer. I just turned 21 so I’m a little over 2 decades old, yet I have spent half of my time alive online contributing my writing and ideas to various platforms. I’ve written everything from blog posts, to captions, stories, to scripts.</p>
								<p>I started off my journey into digital writing by utilizing social media then slowly tested the waters with platforms that gave me more and more creative freedom. Which also meant less and less guidance to help me.</p>
								<p>When I first started writing I was posting corny love stories on a site called Quotev, which I’m sure would age to me anyone younger than me and confuse anyone older than me. Let’s just say this niche website was basically Wattpad’s lesser-known sibling. But it got the job done for me. It’s actually still the most exposure my writing has ever gotten, with over a thousand readers and a few thousand reads overall I got a roll on sharing my work publicly by collaborating with my friend on a dual-authored story, and I took off from there.</p>
								<p>The more confidence I gained, the more I strayed away from Quotev and explored more popular mainstream medias. One thing Quotev lacked in was its multimodality. You could post ahyperlink that would take you to an image on another site, or use the odd gif in your profile’s bio, but that was about it. Sites like Instagram and Tumblr is where I learned to grow my digital experience beyond just text on a page and into visual and audio-based story telling, not to mention the design and layout experience I gained from Tumblr’s allowance of user-based coding customizations.</p>
								<p>I primarily stuck with these two sites and just got comfortable with how they worked and began creating a following for myself until I eventually reached university and got to showcase everything I learned through various projects, including creating short stories, podcasts, and a blog! Running and creating my own blog turned out to be an especially important project for me because for the first time I successful created my own webpage. Not to say I hadn’t tried on some sketchy free domain platforms, but the key word here is tried. My blog is a great addition to my writing portfolio but most importantly showed me how to eventually create my own website to showcase my work.</p>
								<p>In 2019 I started creating a poetry zine full of my writing and photography. When I finished it, the pandemic had just hit, and I was unable to give out the printed copies I had promised to all hose interested. So instead, I created a website where I could give everyone access to my proudest piece of work. Years and years of learning how to write for online
                platforms and designing my own creative virtual space allowed me to create a chic webpage that embodied my writing and personal style.</p>
                <p> Though I may have spent much of my adolescence online, it has made me a better writer, and better designer because of it. I have taught myself how to write for an audience, how to design and format my writing and customize my writing space, along with teaching myself to be multimodal and adapt to all different forms of authoring. I never feel shame for fitting into the stereotype. No, a computer didn’t raise me, nor a phone. But what’s on them taught me valuable lessons, and I probably wouldn’t be a writer without them. It’s time to move into the 21st century and turn writing into a brand-new experience. </p>
