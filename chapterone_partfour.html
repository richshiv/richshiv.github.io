<h3>Delivery: There is Delight</h3>

<p>Beyond collaboration and revision, authors described delivery practices in relation to good feelings. By delivery practices, I mean releasing the final publication in said journal issue and sharing the publication on social media as well with peers and administrators. When I asked participants to tell me the most pleasurable part of their project, they most often said something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>“It was nice to see it published.” <br>
“Publishing the piece! Having it finished! Having people see it and read it and appreciate it!” <br>
“Collecting data. Imagining together. Seeing it published.” <br>
“It was really helpful for me on the job market. It helped me apply for digital literacy jobs.”<br>
“I think the most pleasure was just seeing the final whole web text. I love [one collaborator’s] front webpage thing that he did, and I love the spatiotemporal circulation map that [another collaborator] and I worked out together. The whole intellectual process of figuring all this out was very pleasurable” </blockquote>
<p>While it’s no surprise that many authors feel good when a text is finished and published (don’t we all?), what is surprising are the ways in which delivery practices, just like collaborative acts, complicate feelings about drafting and revising practices. I want to return to Helen’s story of responding to feedback and specifically the moment she said: “Rejections can be the biggest gift you’ll ever get, because a good rejection with good feedback on it can make for an incredible project somewhere else. So, I’m very, very thankful to whoever it was who rejected my book” (personal communication, March 13, 2018). Perhaps Helen’s sentiment didn’t exist before her video book’s publication and the accolades that followed. The same idea applies to Brooke and Andy, two graduate students whose works helped them on the job market. Now an assistant professor, Andy told me in a Skype interview that his webtext was “huge” on the job market. “Everyone said this article got me hired or offers” (personal communication, 2018). In affective terms, Andy also said the publication helped him gain “confidence in approaching other editors and just sending stuff out because I had one in the bag. Having that first publication or two in the field, makes you feel like, ‘Alright I might actually prove myself to be part of the club.’” After delivering his text, job hiring committees wanted to meet him, forging new relationships.</p>
<p>The authors I feature in the above passages underscore that delivery is bit like affective remixing, through which good feelings reframe painful composing and otherwise negative experiences with writing and revising. Working through those drafting and revising pains, authors gained lines on CVs, accolades, jobs, and merits in tenure and promotion portfolios. In a digital media production cycle, pain’s value, that is, isn’t exactly clear until publication&mdash;until it really feels like its alive on the web. Alex, for example, composed a multimodal memoir on a troubled childhood. The pain of re-living his formative years parlayed into pleasure when he presented excerpts to a public audience at university. When he met a department chair in the humanities after, “I was so touched when he said this is deeply moving and theoretically sharp” (personal communication, February 23, 2018). emphasis added). Alex had more to say about the entanglement of pain and pleasure in his composing process.</p>
<blockquote>I love trying new things with writing, and I think that we learn to write by trying to write in ways we’ve never written before, by trying out new genres of writing, trying out new audiences or publics to write to. I love that about writing. So for me, while it was hard and sometimes painful, emotionally evocative, and rich [to compose a multimodal memoir], it was also very pleasurable to see that come together, and to understand that I could write both in a theoretically sophisticated way but also in a personally powerful way (personal communication, February 23, 2018)</blockquote>
<p>Among all participants, there was only one instance in which delivery took a negative albeit somewhat comical turn. Teaching a visual rhetoric course to graduate students, Henry decided to assign his own digital book, which intervenes in the scholarly landscape of rhetoric and comics studies. According to Henry, his assignment was a means to demonstrating what a digital book can do that print can’t. He opened the discussion with a question, a prompt that led to self-induced terror.</p> 
<blockquote>I started off by saying, “What kind of argument does [the book’s author] make?” I sat back and I said, “Oh, that tastes bad. I hate myself for saying that. Hey, guys. Um. I just realized I’m wildly unprepared to teach my own book. So, let’s just talk. What did you think? Don’t spare my feelings.” I had this, like, existential crisis of faith. It was great. It was terrifying to my core and I was like, “Oh. Nope. Can’t do that”(personal communication, February 22, 2018)</blockquote> 
<p>Speaking also of talking about one’s own digital book, Helen argues that creators need to share their digital media scholarship with public audiences and educate those less familar with its approaches. Some target audiences? Tenure and promotion committees who evaluate scholarship and service. “And I know it’s annoying, but one has to educate others so they can evaluate [a digital project] accordingly. So that’s something that … it’s an added annoyance to the work, but it’s also great because then you’re opening doors for others to do that work” (personal communication, March 13, 2018). Put differently, talking about your final publication, as participants of my study have done, might show aspiring authors and evaluators that digital composing isn’t as scary as it might seem on the surface. However, perhaps there is an intellectual cost to educating audiences. Take Henry’s response when asked about composing a video walkthrough on the homepage of his digital book.</p>  
<blockquote>Oh, I’ve got such mixed feelings on it. I love it and I think it’s so necessary to teach people how to read what you’re doing. The things I don’t like about it are the sense to which I’m prescribing things to people and telling them the way that they have to do something. And so luckily, I had that discovery that the more I prescribe, the less people follow my rules, and that’s fantastic. I’m less scared about giving people those rules now, because I know that they’re going to not follow them. They’re going to misbehave (personal communication, February 22, 2018)</blockquote>  
<p>Beyond educating audiences, Helen suggests that authors need to take pride in their digital work and the excitement that surrounds its release. In her words,</p> 
<blockquote>My god, [her book] is a peer-reviewed publication at one of the oldest and most prestigious digital presses. It is 100% a book. [The university] recognizes it 100% as a book, and they are thrilled by this. The department loves it, the college loves it, they wrote an article about it. The college wrote a big time story about it and then it became a [university] “pride point,” which is when [the university] features the most exciting things that our professors have done (personal communication, March 13, 2018)</blockquote>  
<p>In a way, Helen is inviting future composers to learn about common feelings&mdash;confusion, disinterest&mdash;that peers and publics have when they encounter, review or simply read digital media scholarship. If a book unfolds in a non-linear, digital environment, then its final delivery and subsequent promotion might raise its profile and prestige in the academy, thereby creating an economy of good feelings around it. My study participants suggest that authors of digital media scholarship simply have to do more work to create such an economy&mdash;to prove the value of their work, to keep the lights on in their offices when they go up for tenure and promotion.</p>
