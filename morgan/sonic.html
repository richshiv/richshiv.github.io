							<h4>A Story About Cyberwriting</h4>
						</header>
						<p>This sonic essay aurally details my self-discovery and self-recognition as a cyberwriter. Moving from pen and paper and sketchbooks to Adobe After Effects, I learned that the modern vision of writing should and must involve technology.</p>

							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> This is what my life sounded like for three weeks. These are the sounds I heard not when I was on Plan A or Plan B, but on Plan C of one of my biggest, most frustrating, most rewarding digital projects. These are the sounds of writer and machine collaborating in a story about how I recognized myself as a cyberwriter.</p>
							<p align="left"><b>[previous background music stops with a final, energetic drum beat. Pause. A new song begins: it is an upbeat song featuring a drum kit, electric bass, and electric guitar </b><i>(OneEightFour, 2017).</i><b>]</b></p>
							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> Before going into “Plan C,” here’s some context. I’m Sophie, a Professional Writing and French Studies student. December 2019, I joined the Professional Writing Students' Association’s symposium, <i>Mindscapes</i>, and wrote a paper on emotion’s role in the writing process. Not yet knowing how Covid-19 would affect our plans, we established Plan A: reading our papers in-person.</p>
							<p align="left"><b>[sound of record screeching to a stop; silence]</b></p>
							<p align="left"><b>Doug Ford:</b> [from the sound of a television] Effectively immediately, Ontario is declaring a state of emergency <i>(Global News, 2020)</i>.</p>
							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> That was Ontario premier Doug Ford, by the way.
							<p align="left"><b>[a different upbeat background track resumes. The song features notes from a trombone and additional percussion instruments </b><i> (Kid Kodi, 2017).</i><b>]</b></p>
							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> That was also when the lockdown happened and when we knew Plan A was no longer a possibility. So, we decided to continue the symposium virtually, and we created a website to host our digital creations. This soon-to-be digital version of my paper was Plan B. Plan B was challenging; I had to re-imagine my “live” paper multimodally. Set on animation, I chose to visualize my essay through a whiteboard animation video.</p>
							<p align="left"><b>[sound of pen drawing on paper is heard from background]</b></p>
							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> I sketched a storyboard and sent it to my panelists for feedback. And then, while waiting, things took a turn for the worse:</p>
							<p align="left"><b>[background music stops. There is a moment of silence.]</b></p>
							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> I injured my hand.</p>
							<p align="left"><b>[low-mood music begins. The song features a heavier electric bass and ominous tones</b><i> (The Killjoy Brothers, 2020).</i><b>]</b></p>
							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> I couldn’t write—never mind draw—for three weeks. I was so frustrated, but I was also so committed to animating my video, which I finally had a vision of. After some research, I found Plan C: Adobe After Effects. Plan C was scary. I launched myself into a software that I had never used for a huge project that was only three weeks away. I also felt alienated by the foreign technical application. I felt like I was in a cockpit, seeing hundreds of buttons and not knowing what any of them do.</p>
							<p align="left"><b>[there is a pause before new, more upbeat music begins. The high-energy song features an organ, an acoustic guitar, a drum kit and a piano </b><i> (These Times, 2016).</i><b>]</b></p>
							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> But then something strange, but amazing, started happening: I was actually animating my video, for real! I asked myself: did it have to do with me learning what the buttons do? With me watching tutorial after tutorial? No.</p>
							<p align="left">It had to do with me and my new understanding of digital writing. It had to do with my decision to stop following my storyboard designed for a whiteboard and my decision to adapt to my new, digital reality.</p>
							<p align="left"> Instead, as I re-composed, I learned to re-develop and re-write my paper and storyboard as I animated and as I recognized After Effects’ possibilities. I noticed myself inventing alongside and collaborating with a software in a way I had never done before. After Effects guided my composing. Yes, it sometimes discouraged me, but it showed me how to negotiate—and accept—the tensions between human creativity and technical possibility. In the end, I created four animated videos that I was truly proud of!</p>
							<p align="left"> Looking back, I see how important this project was in my digital journey. I learned to use previous knowledge, such as my experience in visual rhetoric, to explore new programs. I also learned— “hands-on” — about the act of Invention using digital media. This project showed me that part of creating digitally is working through the technical problems that arise to arrive at new possibilities. That it is working in tandem with the machine, creating with it, not against it. That it is accepting your existence as a cyberwriter and allowing the machine to influence your composition process (Porter).</p>

							<p align="left"><b>Sophie:</b> These are the sounds of Invention because I, probably like you, am a cyberwriter whose creative process is ultimately intertwined with, limited and propelled by a machine.</p>
