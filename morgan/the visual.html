							<h2>A Story About Cyberwriting</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This video visually details my self-discovery and self-recognition as a cyberwriter. Moving from pen and paper and sketchbooks to Adobe After Effects, I learned that the modern vision of writing should and must involve technology.</p>

    <td><b>Stewart Cheifet:</b> The future was, uh..., going to made of technology (Net Café, 1996).<br><br>
<i>[brief sound of static before the video transitions into the next clip.]</i></td>
    <td>A video of an individual’s hands typing on a keyboard plays in the background. Overlaid on top of the video is the following quote from Jim Porter, “The writer and the machine have become one—the cyberwriter—but we haven’t yet engaged the full implications of that metaphor. We still have a lot of work to do” (2002).
The screen then “glitches” and cuts to black.</td>

    <td>0:07-0:19</td>
    <td><b>Sophie:</b> Welcome to Plan C. Welcome to the moments when I finally recognized myself as a cyberwriter. Before going into “Plan C,” here’s some context.<br><br>
<i>[a new song begins: it is an upbeat song featuring a drum kit, electric bass, and electric guitar (OneEightFour, 2017).]</i></td>
    <td>There is a screen recording of Sophie animating in Adobe After Effects with small webcam shot of Sophie working in the upper right-hand corner. The animation consists of a boy sitting in front of a brick wall writing in a notebook. “June 2020” briefly appears as a time stamp in the bottom left-hand corner.</td>

	<tr>
    <td>0:20-0:29</td>
    <td><b>Sophie:</b> Plan A started when I joined the Professional Writing Students’ Association’s symposium, Mindscapes, with the goal to read our papers live. Plan A didn’t last very long....<br><br>
<i>[the upbeat song continues (OneEightFour, 2017). Typing on a keyboard is faintly heard in the background.]</i></td>
    <td>There is a screen recording of an email being written to the Professional Writing Students’ Association regarding the Mindscapes symposium. The text reads, “Hello PWSA, I have attached my abstract for the Mindscapes Symposium.” “Dec 2019” briefly appears as a time stamp in the bottom left-hand corner.
The screen then “glitches” again and cuts to the next scene.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>0:29–0:32</td>
    <td><b>Doug Ford:</b> Effectively immediately, Ontario is declaring a state of emergency.<br><br>
<i>[music stops]</i></td>
    <td>A video of Doug Ford’s provincial press conference plays on the screen. Ford is at the podium speaking and four masked politicians stand behind him. “March 2020” briefly appears as a time stamp in the bottom left- hand corner.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>0:33–0:44</td>
    <td><b>Sophie:</b> Plan B happened next: I chose to visualize my essay through a whiteboard animation video to post on the Mindscapes website...and that’s as far as Plan B went.<br><br>
<i>[the upbeat song resumes (OneEightFour, 2017). Sounds of sketching, writing, and a book closing are heard in the background.]</i></td>
    <td>A video of Sophie sketching her storyboard plays. She then closes her sketchbook and checks off “Send panelists storyboard,” which is written on a bright yellow Post-It note. Sophie removes her hand from the frame, but once it returns, it is in a brace. Sophie is unable to pick up a pencil with her braced- hand. “May 2020” briefly appears as a time stamp in the bottom left-hand corner.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>0:45-1:00</td>
    <td><b>Sophie:</b> And so, there I was...face to face with Plan C: Adobe After Effects. Plan C was scary. I launched myself into a software that I had never used for a huge project that was only three weeks away.<br><br>
<i>[low-mood music begins. The song features a heavier electric bass and ominous tones (The Killjoy Brothers, 2020).]<i></td>
    <td>A screen recording of After Effects opening on a laptop plays. A split screen of After Effects and a Word document containing the story board appears on screen. There is very little animation occurring.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>1:01–1:06</td>
    <td><b>Sophie:</b> But then something strange started happening. Why?<br><br>
<i>[low-mood music continues (The Killjoy Brothers, 2020). After the word “Why?,” there is a mouse click.].<i></td>
    <td>Still using the split screen, Sophie closes the Word Document containing the storyboard and focuses solely on animating.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>1:06-1:35</td>
    <td><b>Sophie:</b> I had adapted to my new, digital reality. As I re-composed, I re-developed and re-wrote my paper and storyboard as I animated and as I recognized After Effects’ possibilities. I invented alongside and collaborated with a software in a way I had never done before. After Effects guided my composing. It showed me how to negotiate—and accept—the tensions between human creativity and technical possibility.<br><br>
<i>[low-mood music stops (The Killjoy Brothers, 2020). There is a pause before new, more upbeat music begins. The high-energy song features an organ, an acoustic guitar, a drum kit and a piano (These Times, 2016). Throughout, there are sounds of mouse clicking and keyboard typing in the background.]</i></td>
    <td>The After Effects screen recording enters full screen, and a time-lapse of Sophie animating in Adobe After Effects plays. There is also a small webcam shot of Sophie working in the upper right-hand corner.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>1:35-1:59</td>
    <td><b>Sophie:</b> It taught me that part of creating digitally is working through the technical problems that arise to arrive at new possibilities. That it is working in tandem with the machine, creating with it, not against it. That it is accepting your existence as a cyberwriter and allowing the machine to influence your composition process.<br><br>
<i>[upbeat music continues (These Times, 2016). A brief noise of static is then heard that concludes the video.]</i></td>
    <td>The screen recording switches to a window with the final product on screen that is on the Mindscapes website. The first half of “Part One: How It All Began” plays. “June 26, 2020” briefly appears as a timestamp in the bottom left-hand corner.
The screen then fades to black and “glitches” out to “No Signal.”</td>
