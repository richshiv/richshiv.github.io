                </p>The year 2018 was the year I plunged further into the world of digital media more than any year.</p>
						   	</p>I remember it precisely because it was my first time posting on Instagram in years – it was for </p>
								</p>prom by the way.Posting on Instagram wasn’t why it was so memorable, I realized that majority of my </p>
								</p>unforgettable digital media experience came from that year. I created podcasts that year and shot and </p>
								</p>edited more than two professional YouTube videos for school assignments. Diving into the </p>
							</p>digital media world through school helped me see that there was so much freedom for creativity online. </p>
							</p>It stirred a deep desire to be more creative with digital media and be productive with my imagination.</p>
              </p>I can’t remember what gave me the idea, but sometime that year of 2018, I approached my mother, who’s </p>
							</p>a pastry chef, and gave her an idea of opening her page. She had just begun pastry school, and she had a </p>
							</p>home business, I thought “wouldn’t it be easier if you sold and offered your service through an online </p>
							</p>platform?” She loved the idea, so I decided to build her website using WIX without any website development</p>
							</p>experience. At that time, I had never heard of WordPress, WIX appeared more visually pleasing, but now in 2020, </p>
							</p>I realize that WIX was very restricting. Nonetheless, I built the website added photos, but I didn’t have my </p>
							</p>mothers permission to sell products because I didn’t know enough about how the payment system worked with WIX.</p>

              </p>Fast-forward to 2019. A professor introduced me to WordPress, and I was very excited to start blogging that year </p>
							</p>thrilled to explore a new digital media because WIX failed me.
              	<p>[PAUSE]</p>
              </p>It made me believe that I wasn’t capable of building a website because of my inexperience, but WordPress was different.</p>
							</p> I didn’t know anything about coding, yet for every widget, WordPress offers a how-to tutorial. I especially </p>
							</p>love the free templates provided it made my page look clean and unique without any payment. For many months that </p>
							was the only experience, I had concerning WordPress. </p>

              </p>Finally, in the year 2020, I took part in a life-changing internship, the project due at the end of the program was “how to move</p>
							</p> small businesses to an online platform during covid-19.” Everyone on my team carried similar or less experience than me, so we </p>
							</p>struggled initially. However, I learned so much about website development. I learned that before creating any sort of media </p>
							</p>platform one needs to strategize; we created a website called “Local Market.” This website was all about giving small businesses </p>
							</p>a smooth transition to an online platform. I still don’t know how to code, but I learned to develop a marketing budget, customer</p>
							</p> journey maps and a landing page all through the creation of Local Market. I also learned that to have a successful website one </p>
							</p>needs to create traffic using SEO’s (search engine optimizations) such as google analytics. In fewer words, I learned that </p>
							</p>there’s more to website development than pretty pictures clear writing. Finally, I realized that WordPress simply offers everything</p>
							</p> I need to build a successful website. Yes like WIX, I still have to pay for premium access on WordPress; however, WordPress </p>
							</p>offers various videos of how to get started to building a website, that even the least experienced, has a chance on building a </p>
							successful website.</p>
