				<p> Hi! I'm Lyniesha (friends call me Lenny) and welcome to my <em>digital journey</em>.
					Here, I reflect on my digital practices and how they contribute to my digital authoring.
					This includes looking at my longest digital practice; Tumblr and a new practice that poses
					more of a challenge; WordPress. While my first WordPress remains in the digital graveyard
					for discarded accounts, you can check out my new blog, <a href="https://lennyspizza.wordpress.com/">Lennyspizza</a>

				<p>
				Looking back now, the sonic essay was a very meta experience. While reflecting on my digital journey
					with Tumblr and WordPress, I was also relearning audio editing with SoundTrap. My first experience with
					audio was with Audacity for a podcast assignment. The experience was a bit difficult and fustrating but
					 it taught me patience and persistent that I was able to use with SoundTrap. In the end, these experiences
					  furthered my digital expansion.

						<strong>(Calisson begins to play)</strong>
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>(Sounds of computer mouse clicking followed by computer trash bin being emptied)</strong> As a writer, I struggled with finding my voice on different digital platforms. My
						longest-running digital footprint is a Tumblr blog I created in 2011. I was 14 and looking for a platform that could offer some escape from Twitter and Facebook. I found Tumblr at what seemed like the right time. I discovered a platform
						where I could write, post images or just reblog content to match the theme of my blog.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>(Clicking fades out to the song, Donnalee. Sounds of a pencil writing on paper)</strong>
						<br> But I’ll be honest, I’m more of a pen and paper sort of composer. I can fill the blank pages of a new journal with random thoughts,
						unfinished stories or random doodles. <strong>(Music and sound effects stop)</strong> But my imagination and creativity always felt blocked on a digital platform. <strong>(Fade in Jodon)</strong> Part of the difficulty came with
						understanding the demands of a new platform so, it was no surprise to me that I returned to Tumblr at my first failed attempt at WordPress in 2019.</p>

					<p>At the time, WordPress was a new digital landscape that I was not used to or comfortable with. As people and not just writers, we go where we are comfortable.<strong>(Music stops)</strong> However,<strong>(computer mouse clicking fades
							in, Plasticity begins to play)</strong> learning the layout of a new digital platform did open my eyes to my own limitations and mental block that affect my writing. I had to not only deliver my own content and voice with WordPress but
						also develop an eye for <em>formatting, style, and display</em>; a few concepts that Tumblr’s mobile app completed for me.</p>

					<p>Tumblr not only made easy for me to use the app and website,<strong> (music and sound effects pauses)</strong> but it also made me invisible <strong>(Music continues)</strong> and then it connected me to people who also share that
						ability. It was like sitting in a very comfortable silence with the occasional conversation popping up from other users. The community is what brought me back each time. I enjoyed how low maintenance owning a Tumblr blog was. So,
						venturing off into a new platform also meant exploring and learning the discourse of that community, which in the beginning, <strong>(music stops)</strong> I don’t think I was prepared for.</p>

					<p><strong>(sound of computer trash bin being cleared again)</strong><br><strong>(madness fades in the background. Keyboard typing)</strong><br> I can reflect back now and honestly say that I stood in my own way and was <em>impatient</em>
						with learning the new platform. My expectations were too high and fell so low when I eventually deleted my WordPress account. I neglected, procrastinated and avoided all forms of productivity because mentally I wasn’t ready to start all
						over.</p>

					<p><strong>(Madness stops, the song Jumbel begins to play)</strong><br> My experience with WordPress taught me that starting over, turning over a new leaf, or trying something new is appealing in theory; but when I began the process, I
						couldn’t help but feel isolated on a platform filled with millions of users. Because this platform was new and I had already spent 8 years on Tumblr, the blog was forgotten in the land of abandoned accounts.<strong>(song stops)</strong>
					</p>

					<p>Despite that, <strong>(Coronea fades in)</strong> I’m returning back to WordPress this year and I’m feeling good about starting over this time. I’m honestly more equipped and ready to work with this platform because I’m not looking to
						replace something that I already know, <strong>(Keyboard typing fades in and out)</strong> I’m just looking to explore and develop my writing style and creativity. Much like the act of writing – or creating anything for that matter --
						progress comes with a string of revision and editing; and it also comes with the mindset that what is created is not finite.<strong> (Cornea fades out)</strong></p>

				<h2 class="major">Video Essay</h2>
				<p> Video essays are my favourite type of YouTube videos. So creating one was, not only a lot of fun, but also served as a preview to contributing to a community that I admire. Stepping out of the shadows of the viewer into the shoes of
					the creator was a nice change in scenerio. I hope you all watch and enjoy the video! </p>
