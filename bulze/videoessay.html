										<td>My longest-running digital footprint is a Tumblr blog I created in 2011. I was 14 and looking for a platform that could offer some escape from Twitter and Facebook. I found Tumblr at what seemed like the right time</td>

										<td>(Shots of me writing in a small note pad)</td>
										<td><strong>(Clicking fades out to the song, Donnalee. Sounds of a pencil writing on paper)</strong> But I’ll be honest, I’m more of a pen and paper sort of composer. I can fill the blank pages of a new journal with random thoughts, unfinished stories or random doodles.</td>

										<td>(0:42-0:52)</td>
										<td>(cut to buffering screen)</td>
										<td><strong>(Music and sound effects stop)</strong> But my imagination and creativity always felt blocked on a digital platform.<strong> (Fade in Jodon)</strong> Part of the difficulty came with understanding the demands of a new platform,</td>

										<td> (Title screen: However)(Cut to a close up of drafts on WordPress)</td>
										<td><strong> (Music stops)</strong> However,<strong>(computer mouse, clicking fades in, Plasticity begins to play)</strong> learning the layout of a new digital platform did open my eyes to my own limitations and mental block that affect my writing.</td>

									<tr>
										<td>(1:18-1:30)</td>
										<td>(Cut to my blog preview page for “The Artist & The Muse” draft post;speech bubble pop up)</td>
										<td>I had to not only deliver my own content and voice with WordPress but also develop an eye for formatting, style, and display; a few concepts that Tumblr’s mobile app completed for me.</td>

The community is what brought me back each time. I enjoyed how low maintenance owning a Tumblr blog was.</td>
