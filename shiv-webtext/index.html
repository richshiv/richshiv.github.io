<h1><strong>This sucks&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>Over the last decade, virtual reality (VR) technologies have steadily transitioned from entertainment and gaming applications into professional knowledge work environments, with major technology companies positioning VR and mixed reality headsets as productivity solutions for complex cognitive tasks. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple market these devices specifically to knowledge workers, including academic researchers, professional writers, and graduate students, promising &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; or &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; workspace configurations (Apple Vision Pro, 2025), distraction-free immersive environments, and unprecedented focus through spatial computing. In response, universities have begun investing in VR infrastructure, with writing centers exploring immersive tutoring possibilities (Rojas-Alfaro, 2024), and graduate research programs increasingly encouraging experimentation with emerging composing technologies (Hewitt et al., 2009; VanKooten, 2016). Yet as these technologies move from margins to mainstream, technical communication scholars face a critical imperative: to examine empirically how VR actually functions as a writing tool in authentic academic contexts before adoption decisions become institutionally entrenched.</p>
<p>This imperative is particularly urgent for several reasons. First, technical and professional communication (TPC) has long served as a field that critically examines emerging composing technologies&mdash;from static to interactive and multimodal digital tools&mdash;documenting both affordances and constraints, identifying who benefits and who is excluded, and providing evidence-based guidance for practitioners and educators (Haas, 1996; Wysocki, 2004; Melon&ccedil;on &amp; St.Amant, 2019). As VR enters academic writing contexts, TPC scholars are uniquely positioned to conduct the user-centered research necessary to understand these technologies beyond marketing claims and proof-of-concept demonstrations (Tham et al., 2018; Lambrecht et al., 2025; Caravella &amp; Shivener, 2026). Second, graduate students represent a particularly vulnerable population for technology adoption; they face intense productivity pressures, are often isolated in their work, and are susceptible to promises of technological solutions that might alleviate writing anxiety or accelerate progress toward degree completion (Leon &amp; Pigg, 2011; Hauman et al., 2015). Without empirical evidence about sustained VR use for complex academic writing, students may invest time and resources in technologies that impose hidden costs, including but not limited to physical discomfort, technical frustration, or cognitive overload, while institutions make infrastructure investments based on technological enthusiasm rather than pedagogical evidence.</p>
<p>Third, the discourse surrounding VR productivity tools relies heavily on concepts central to technical communication scholarship: user experience, embodied interaction, multimodal composition, and the material conditions of knowledge work. Claims about &ldquo;immersion,&rdquo; &ldquo;presence,&rdquo; and &ldquo;flow&rdquo; in VR environments invoke theoretical constructs that TPC scholars are equipped to interrogate critically (Duin et al., 2016; Shivener &amp; Tham, 2025; Caravella, 2025). Yet current VR research rarely examines sustained use for the kind of complex, recursive, cognitively demanding writing that characterizes academic knowledge production. Studies focus on brief experimental sessions, controlled tasks, or proof-of-concept demonstrations&mdash;not the messy realities of longitudinal writing or design practices.</p>
<p>As our review of literature reveals, the conversation about VR in educational contexts has largely focused on three areas: training simulations (particularly in medical, military, and corporate settings), collaborative learning environments, and data visualization. When VR and writing intersect in the research, studies typically examine creative writing experiments, immersive reading experiences, or collaborative composition in shared virtual spaces (Shivener &amp; Caravella, 2025). What remains largely unexplored is the lived experience of solitary, sustained academic writing in VR&mdash;the kind of deep, complex composing required for in-depth composing processes like dissertation work, where writers must manage lengthy documents, synthesize multiple sources, maintain coherent arguments across chapters, and sustain concentration for hours of intellectual labor.</p>
<p>This gap is significant because academic writing differs fundamentally from the shorter, more bounded writing tasks examined in most VR writing research. Dissertation writing demands not just text production but sustained engagement with complex ideas, recursive revision practices, and the cognitive flexibility to move between reading, note-taking, drafting, and editing (Rainey &amp; Kelly, 1992; Selber, 2004; Tham, 2024). It involves what writing scholars call &ldquo;knowledge-transforming&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;knowledge-telling&rdquo; (Bereiter &amp; Scardamalia, 1987)&mdash;the kind of deep cognitive work that makes significant demands on attention, memory, and metacognitive awareness. If VR is to become a viable tool for academic knowledge work, we need empirical evidence about how it supports or constrains this kind of writing.</p>
<p>Through the lens of user experience (UX), this study addresses that gap via a ten-week diary study of one doctoral candidate&rsquo;s experience composing her dissertation in VR during summer 2025. Through weekly reflective entries, screen recordings, and analytical synthesis, we examine the experiential dimensions of immersive academic writing as they unfolded in authentic context. UX research examines not just whether technologies work but how people experience them over time (Hassenzahl, 2010; Garrett, 2010). Our participant began the study with optimism about VR&rsquo;s potential, noting after her first session: &ldquo;Learned how to set up and use the <em>Immersed</em> app for writing and that stable WiFi is essential for VR functionality.&rdquo; Ten weeks later, after sustained engagement with dissertation writing in VR&mdash;like reading literature review articles, drafting methods sections, coding interview transcripts, and revising administrative documents&mdash;her final diary entry concluded: &ldquo;Work on applying the draft coding framework to one transcript in detail to test whether the categories are functional and comprehensive. Or maybe end the VR work.&rdquo; This trajectory from initial adoption through sustained engagement to eventual reconsideration provides crucial empirical evidence about VR writing&rsquo;s realities, revealing both technological affordances and significant constraints that emerged only through prolonged use.</p>
