<h2><strong>Embodied Writing and Material Technologies</strong></h2>
<p>Writing studies scholarship has decisively established that writing is not a purely mental activity but an embodied practice fundamentally shaped by physical experience, material tools, and bodily engagement (Boyle et al., 2018; Haas, 1996; Johnson, 2007; Prior &amp; Shipka, 2003). This insight, grounded in embodied cognition theory, argues that thinking emerges through bodily interaction with environment, tools, and artifacts rather than occurring solely &ldquo;in the head&rdquo; (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1999; Wilson, 2002). For writing, this means that the physical act of composing actively shapes both process and product. This understanding of composing has informed a long tradition of examining how writers adopt and adapt to composing technologies, from early studies of writers transitioning from pen to typewriter (Haas &amp; Hayes, 1986), to research on word-processing adoption (Haas, 1989), to contemporary work on multimodal and digital composition (Wysocki, 2004; Ball &amp; Charlton, 2015).</p>
<p>Haas&rsquo;s oft-cited research in <em>Writing Technology: Studies on the Materiality of Literacy</em> (1996) demonstrated that different writing technologies afford qualitatively different cognitive and rhetorical possibilities. Her studies of writers transitioning from pen to computer revealed how &ldquo;sense of the text&rdquo;&mdash;that is, writers&rsquo; mental representation of their emerging documents or textual products&mdash;transformed with material conditions. Computer writers gained facility with moving text chunks but sometimes lost spatial sense of document structure; pen writers maintained stronger document awareness but found large-scale revision more difficult. Crucially, Haas argued that writing technologies are never transparent; they actively shape writing through their material affordances and constraints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shipka&rsquo;s (2011) &ldquo;whole composition&rdquo; concept reminds us that composing always involves more than alphabetic-text production; it includes discerning multiple modalities, planning workspaces, gathering materials, managing tools, and creating conditions for concentration. VR makes these typically invisible aspects suddenly visible. Writers must actively construct virtual workspaces, position screens at appropriate distances and angles, manage window sizes, and continuously adjust spatial arrangements. This spatial management becomes part of the composing process itself, competing with cognitive resources needed for actual text production. The multimodal nature of VR writing&mdash;simultaneously navigating spatial environments, manipulating virtual objects through gesture, managing visual attention across multiple screens, and coordinating head movements with hand actions&mdash;intensifies the cognitive and physical labor of writing in ways that deserve systematic examination.</p>
<p>Feminist rhetorical scholars have extended this materialist perspective by insisting that bodies themselves are not neutral. As Royster and Kirsch (2012), Powell (2012), and Dolmage (2014) demonstrate, gender, race, ability, and other bodily differences fundamentally shape rhetorical practice and technology access. Bodies are marked by identity categories, shaped by social contexts, and subject to material constraints that make some writing technologies accessible while rendering others impossible. Melon&ccedil;on&rsquo;s (2013) argument on disability and technical communication particularly emphasizes that accessible design requires attending to diverse embodied experiences rather than assuming a universal &ldquo;user.&rdquo; For VR writing, this attention to embodied difference is essential. Headsets impose specific physical requirements, including the ability to wear devices on heads for extended periods, to view screens through lenses, to hold heads upright, and to tolerate potential motion sickness or visual-vestibular conflicts. Users with migraines, vestibular disorders, photosensitivity, or cervical spine issues may find VR physically painful or impossible, making embodied constraints not peripheral considerations but fundamental design and adoption issues (Caravella &amp; Shivener, 2026).</p>
<p>Moreover, VR introduces concerns with technological embodiment, or the sense of being present in and potentially observed within virtual space (Duin et al., 2016). VR marketing celebrates presence as the technology&rsquo;s defining feature (Jerald, 2015; Slater &amp; Sanchez-Vives, 2016), but presence has complex implications for writing. If writers feel present in a space, they may also feel visible, observed, or self-conscious&mdash;experiences with particular resonance for those already struggling with writing anxiety, impostor syndrome, or surveillance in academic contexts (Rose, 1985; Brooke, 1991). Yet VR writing research has largely overlooked these affective dimensions of immersive presence.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of immersion itself warrants critical examination. VR discourse promises seamless experience and escape from distractions, constructing immersion as unambiguously positive, a state of flow and productivity. However, as media theorists remind us, immersion means being surrounded, submerged, potentially overwhelmed (Murray, 1997; Ryan, 2001). Selfe and Selfe&rsquo;s (1994) analysis of computer interfaces as &ldquo;non-innocent&rdquo; technologies provides a crucial framework: interfaces encode particular cultural assumptions, power relations, and ways of working that advantage some users while marginalizing others. VR interfaces similarly embody assumptions about how bodies should move, how attention should be managed, how writing should be organized spatially. These assumptions clash with writers&rsquo; actual practices, needs, or embodied realities, or what Suchman (2007) calls &ldquo;troublesome&rdquo; moments&mdash;moments when human-machine configurations fail. This set of scholarship establishes that any adequate account of VR writing must prioritize embodied experience, physical constraints, and affective dimensions over technical functionality. As Caravella (2025) insists, &ldquo;the true focus for understanding VR [is] the human being&rdquo; (p. 1).</p>
