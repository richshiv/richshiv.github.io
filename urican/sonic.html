								<h2>Sonic Essay</h2>
								<p>music and typing sounds start
								<p>I've always found social media interesting when I was younger, I created accounts on different social media platforms to try them out and see which one I like best. Like everyone else, I became obsessed with Facebook. I used it every day. I played games. I posted pictures and shared posts almost daily. I used to talk to my friends for hours on Facebook and I simply couldn't get enough of it. In eighth grade, I deleted Facebook. (MacBook delete sound effect)</p>
								<p>I was done with it since not only were people messaging me to ask me to like their profile picture, which annoyed me like nothing else, I was also starting to get very bored because it seemed like I was looking at the same posts every day. But I didn't stay away for long because months later I decided to create a new account on Facebook. But this time I stopped posting every day and I mostly used it to communicate with my friends.</p>
								<p>Now I still use it to communicate with my friends on messenger, but I haven't posted anything in years. </p>
								<p> This pattern of using a social media platform obsessively, then getting bored and then deleting my account only to create a new one is something that I did with all social media platforms.</p>
								<p>After I stopped using Facebook, I turned to Tumblr. I had watched a movie with my friend, and I became huge fans of one of the characters. This led me to download Tumblr. I wanted to look at posts made by people with similar interest and who also like the character. I spent probably hours creating themes for my blog and coming up with new usernames, but I never posted anything myself. I enjoyed reblogging and liking posts, but like with Facebook, I got bored.</p>
								<p>I think since I never interacted with anyone, I didn't form any attachment to the app. It was also not an app that I could use to communicate with my friends, so it became useless for me. So, I deleted my account (MacBook delete sound effect), but again created a new one months later.</p>
								<p>I never learn.</p>
								<p>While using Tumblr, I discovered Twitter since there was no app for group chat at the time, we thought the best way to communicate was on Twitter. So, we used to have full conversations on Twitter, which thank God are now deleted. Twitter was great at the time because people in our class who followed us could join in on the conversation. So, we had a lot of fun. I didn't follow anyone or looked at any posts. I simply used it to communicate with my friends from school.</p>
								<p>But once we graduated from elementary school and we went to different high schools, we stopped talking. So, I stopped using Twitter. So, I deleted Twitter (MacBook delete sound effect) but created a new account years later.</p>
								<p>Although I created a new account, I didn't use it for years until 2019. I started using it again. But I never interact with anyone and I only really check posts that I'm interested in, especially means I use Twitter every day and I haven't gotten bored of it … yet.</p>
								<p>Other than social media. I also like to edit pictures and videos. One app that I use a lot is, InShot, which I have on my phone and no, I haven't deleted the app and installed it again. On InShot, I edit videos but are now deleted because they're so cringe, and I wouldn't want to look at them again.</p>
								<p>So, I guess I still delete things. But the app is safe for … now.</p>
								<p>I can't wait to see what new social media platforms will become popular so I can join, become obsessed and delete just so I can create a new account months later.</p>
								<p>typing sound stops, sent message sound and music stops<p/>
