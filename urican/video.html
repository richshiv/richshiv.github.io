    <dt>0:00- 0:01 Text on screen: Do you really want to delete that?</dt>
    <dd>Music starts -- upbeat</dd>

    <dt>0:01-0:05 Text on screen: Hi! I’m Lorena, and I have a weird habit!</dt>
    <dd>Typewriter sound: Hi! My name is Lorena, and I have a weird habit!</dd>

    <dt>0:06-0:07 Black Screen.</dt>
    <dd>I love social media.</dd>

		<dt>0:07-  0:16 Picture of the Twitter then Tumblr, then Snapchat and then Instagram logo pops up.</dt>
    <dd>I have a twitter, Tumblr, Snapchat and Instagram account. But to honest I’ve probably had at least 3 other accounts on each platform.</dd>

	  <dt>0:17-0:21'Picture of the deactivation page on Twitter and it zooms closer and closer to the deactivation button.</dt>
    <dd>That is because my weird habit is that I constantly delete my social media accounts.</dd>

	  <dt>0:21- 0:36 Scrolling on Twitter, there are various tweets including a gif of a cat on a motorcycle. Writing Tweets: “OMGMGMMMG!!!!” (send)  and “DJHASJAKJSHDAJSKD”(send)</dt>
    <dd>I remember when I first got Twitter. I was obsessed,I used to be one those annoying people that always tweet everything, not only that but also my friends and I used twitter as a group chat. Thankfully those tweets are now deleted.</dd>

		<dt>0:36 -0:50 Cut to: the deactivation page on Twitter. Password is written then click on deactivation. Page that account has been deactivated appears up. Cut to: the deactivation page on Twitter. Password is written then click on deactivation. Page that account has been deactivated appears up.Right after the sign up for Twitter page appears. Writes name, and there’s a cut to the deactivation page again. And then the sign-up page again.</dt>
    <dd>Then I got bored of it, so I deleted my account. I didn’t stay away for long and I was back on twitter months later, BUT AGAIN I deleted my account after a while. Only to be back years later.</dd>

    <dt>0:51-1:12 Tumblr sign up page, and an email is written. Scrolling through Tumblr. Looking at the posters for the Falcon and the Winter Soldier series. Zooms in on the face of the that plays the Winter Soldier. Continues looking at the posters and then like the post. And Scrolls Cut to: Tumblr delete account page. Starts writing when a picture of saying “SIGN UP AGAIN” shows up. Then again, picture of Tumblr sign-up page shows up. Typing “lorena”.</dt>
    <dd>I got Tumblr in 2014 because I was obsessed with the movie the winter soldier. I love that movie but also loved that I could look at posts about other fandoms I was in, but again, I was bored, and I deleted my account. And like with Twitter, I was back months later.</dd>

    <dt>1:13-1:16 Cut to: scrolling on Instagram. There are pictures of cats on the screen.</dt>
    <dd>I literally never learn, and I don’t I will</dd>

		<dt>1:16-1:20 More scrolling and looking at pictures of cats.</dt>
    <dd>Because the same thing happened with Snapchat and Instagram. </dd>

    <dt>1:21-1:32 Instagram delete page. Password is written and page is deleted.</dt>
    <dd>So, I’m very excited and looking forward to the new platforms that will be coming out in the next years. Just so I can create an account and delete it months later.</dd>

    <dt> 1:33 The words “Thank you for watching” appear on the screen.</dt>
