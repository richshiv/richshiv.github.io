<h3>A Scholarly DLC, Webtext Arcade and Process Document: Writing Studies as Living Digital Media</h3>
<p>At the start of this chapter, I stated what might be a given among scholars: When a manuscript is published, whether it’s in print or in a digital space, it’s done. We move on the next one, the next manuscript that helps us add another crucial line to our CV. So my first question in this final section of Ch. 4 is this—can we afford to make updates to digital media scholarship in response to its initial public circulation and reader feedback? What’s at stake for those who attempt—and have attempted—this delivery approach?</p>
<p><i>Scholarly DLCs</i></p>
<p>There is a fine line between releasing projects in progress and updating it after its publication. Echoing my comments in Chapter Two, I would argue that Nathaniel Rivers and Jeremy Tirrell’s <cite>Following Mechanical Turks</cite> project is living digital media in progress, similar to games under Steam’s Early Access program. Rivers and Tirrell have uploaded more than 100 files to the project’s repository since 2019. They livestream discussions about their project and release notes and features of it. (By the time this book is in circulation, they might be done.) However, it doesn’t appear that the team is directly engaging with constant feedback on features and writings of the project. Still, their project’s approach constitutes a combination of highly visible collaboration in situ. At the time of writing this chapter, I wonder what updates will take place after the project is fully published. I wonder this, too, about the very project that you are reading now.</p>
<p>For this discussion, I’m most interested in projects that have been in circulation as final projects. For example, Alexander Hidalgo’s (2017) video book, <cite>Cámara Retórica: A Feminist Filmmaking Methodology for Rhetoric and Composition</cite>, is a six-part series of short films on feminist filmmaking practices and its practitioners. How has this project evolved since its publication in 2017? This question is not designed to critique Hidalgo’s completed work, but to evoke wonder about what insights have emerged since <em>Cámara Retórica</em>’s publication. Wonder is a feeling that digital media projects can embrace well, according to Susan Delagrange (2011).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Interactive digtial media can be designed as technologies of wonder, epistemically active digital <cite>Wunderkammern</cite>, spaces where we can accumulate, explore, and make meaning from a superabundance of visual, verbal, and auditory materials in digital formats.” (p. 153, Delagrange)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like games, digital media scholarship can foreground wonder through navigation choice and updates after publication. In 2019, Jason Helms published “Play Smarter Not Harder: Developing Your Scholarly Meta” in the open-access electronic journal, <cite>Scholarly and Research Communication</cite>. In “Play Smarter,” you take on the role of a scholar who is writing at article over a 50-day period. In this text-based game, you make decisions about committing time to drafting print or digital media, conducting research, revising your project, and taking time off. It’s a game that branches as you go, revealing your days left, your page count, and your emotional states. As it tells me in a recent playthrough, “Pages written: You have written 0 of your planned 25 pages. Emotions: you perceive yourself as more challenged than skilled, leaving you feeling anxious.” A complete playthrough of the game unlocks a “a debug mode that makes its arguments more explicit.”</p>
<p>[GIF of a game in progress]</p>
<p>Caption: A brief demonstration of Jason Helms’ text-based game-as-scholarship, Play Smarter Not Harder: Developing Your Scholarly Meta, published in the open-access electronic journal, Scholarly and Research Communication. This GIF depicts a web browser and linkable text with sentences such as “(#check)  .”</p>
<p>Since its publication on July 2, 2019, the game has not been updated—or perhaps updates haven’t been publicly announced (e.g., on the journal’s website). And that makes sense. Unlike what we see on games pages at <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> and Steam, a page detailing change logs are practically nonexistent on the pages of digital media scholarship. It’s not an expectation of the field of writing studies and academia writ large. If we have textual and technical errors in a digital argument, we fix it or we contact editors to help us. (This dialogue happens every so often at the online journal for which I edit.) We often don’t make updates public knowledge. Generally, when the article is published, that’s it. Done. The article’s link circulates in inboxes, social media feeds, and professional portfolios. This circulation is what my department calls knowledge mobilization.</p>
<p>To align with the rhetorical-affective production cycles of game devs, then, what updates for “Play Smarter Not Harder” would be appropriate? Helms might add an update, such as “the second article.” It would be a scholarly downloadable content (DLC). Or perhaps he might unlock debug mode for anyone to play through. Within the game, Helms’ comment on prototyping prompts me think about the lifespan of feedback in scholarship vs. game development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to think that all scholarship is academic prototyping. In a long view, scholarly interventions are feedback mechanisms, but they’re not that rapid. In my own experience, I’ve found that new media scholarship offers more opportunities for immediate feedback to improve the prototype.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Toward the Webtext Arcade</i></p>
<p>If all scholarship is academic prototyping, how do we extend its feedback mechanisms beyond initial publication and capture the labour that figures into such an extension? One idea is to encourage reinterpreting a piece for another publication or venue. These reinterpreations happen in ethical ways all the time in our field, as we’re parlaying works in progress or finished articles into presentations at field conferences or vice versa. In fact, in 2008, Jacqueline Rhodes and Jonathan Alexander presented the multimedia installation “Multimedia[ted] [E]visceration” at the Watson Conference at the University of Louisville. The installation was later published as a webtext chapter in <cite>The New Work of Composing</cite> (2012). That said, a game like Helms—and many of the digtial media scholarship examples discussed in this book—could be arranged for a kind of webtext installation, similar to GDC’s Alt.Ctrl. At the Computers and Writing 2022 conference, in fact, the organizers highlighted several presenters as “emergent voices.” These voices were invited to create virtual projects ahead of the conference and participate in Q&amp;A sessions about their projects at the in-person conference. This intentional approach to invite participants to engage with digital projects at the conference more closely aligned with the demonstrations by game developers featured in this chapter. These scholars received immediate feedback in digital and physical spaces and could carry them forward to manuscripts.</p>
<p>Installing and sharing work this way is also similar to poster presentations at conferences. The Conference on College Composition and Communication and Computers and Writing conference have poster sessions and welcome media-rich presentations. Perhaps Computers and Writing is the best conference space for blending in-person and digital interactions with works-in-progress and published webtexts. While the conference presentation as a genre is interactive, a dedicated space, a kind of open arcade for webtexts might allow for more attendee agency and temporally flexible ways of giving and receiving feedback. The DMAC Institute at The Ohio State University commits an afternoon for participants to showcase their work to staff, faculty advisors and fellow participants in an open format. For example, a draft video I composed at DMAC 2018 was displayed on a computer and accompanied by a notebook in which viewers could leave anonymous comments, a kind of low-key proxy of posting comments on a YouTube video. While my project afforded passive viewing, the arrangement of the event and the delivery of the project felt interactive and welcomed rapid, immediate feedback.</p>

<p>Caption: A notebook redacted with handwritten comments about the author’s video submission at the DMAC Institute. IF I CAN FIND IT!</p>
<p>Similar to DMAC, the webtext arcade could run for an entire day or concurrently with the conference programming, much like Alt.Ctrl on GDC’s expo floor. But I hazard to strongly suggest that it run throughout the conference due to the notably time committment of presenting said webtext. As Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker told me in our interview about Alt.Ctrl, demonstrating <cite>Plinko Burger</cite> required hours and hours of standing and talking with people for three days in a row: “We had the support of all those people around, but we were very focused on running the booths the whole time. So, there was a lot of back-to-back just talking to people for like six hours and running this game and having that experience. I think we didn’t have any major technical issues, which was pretty wonderful.”</p>
<p>[INSERT IMAGE]</p>
<p>Caption: A GIF of Zayna Sheikh and David Vicker dancing at the convention.</p>
<p>An approach like this might be a big ask for digital media scholarship. Simply put, hosting a poster or project at a table or booth in a public space all day isn’t a disciplinary expectation. And let’s own up to something: We aren’t selling a game.</p>
<p>Perhaps the middle ground is something like the aforementioned IGF Pavilion, where conference participants can freely play games. A computer lab demonstrating all the works might do the rhetorical trick. Furthermore, many academic institutions have labs for these activities already. The Webtext Arcade could be a productive partnership with an institution’s library, which have in their own ways become sites of media production (Mackenzie &amp; Martin, 2016; Nelson, 2021). That said, what might be the specific asks? Immediately, I think of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 computers connected to Ethernet</li>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Movable tables</li>
</ul>
<p>These asks are commonplace items in labs and the kind of installation setups at gaming conventions. Perhaps the biggest ask is the promotion of the arcade and incentive to present. We need to further recognize and celebrate myriad works of digital media scholarship—past, present and future, particularly those on the horizon. Beyond appearing in digital publications and institutes, a webtext arcade could amplify living digital media in our field, perhaps even resulting in more submissions.</p>
<p><i>Documenting Our Work</i></p>
<p>Aside from the two above approaches, documentation might be the best option for extending the lifespan of digital media scholarship. As I argue earlier in this book, we need to publicly document and reflect on our digital media scholarship more often, and we need to do a better job of arguing that documentation is a public-facing service. Whether modeling after Brayicsky’s change logs or Sheikh and Vicker’s documentation on GitHub, tracking and writing about our revisions can be an enormous resource for fellow and future scholars. While drafting and revising a webtext, scholars might record their screens, capture screenshots of every draft, and upload versions to GitHub. This stuff, what I call ephemera, accompanies the revised submissions we collect from students. Ephemera allows for a contextualized assessment of the revised submission. Asking for and submitting ephemera animates the interpersonal circulation of a production, foregrounding a culture of affective openness that forms between bodies.</p>
<p>Let me put it frankly: For many of us, writing a webtext is hard as hell. For our peers and reviewers, let’s document how we made our way out of development hell.</p>
