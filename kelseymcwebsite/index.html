							<h2><strong>A little bit about me!</strong></h2>
							<p>Being born and raised in Canada by a hockey family, I was pretty much destined to become an athlete when I grew older. At just the age of three, I  started to learn how to skate. I would constantly run around the house holding a mini stick and tried to play hockey with everything and anything I could possibly get my hands on. This passion and love for the game of hockey gave me the opportunity to attend York University on a hockey scholarship, where I was able to play the sport I love and pursue an education of my choice. Throughout my years at York, I have played 5 seasons with the York Lions, graduated with a major in Liberal Arts and Communications and I’m in the process of graduating with a second degree, majoring in Professional Writing. Throughout the process of completing my degrees, I have found my rhythm as a writer and love for online platforms. Many people may see social media as a trap, however, I see how social media and other online platforms enhance people’s ability to write, communicate, market and, show artistic abilities. As a social media coordinator, I have been gifted the opportunity to freely write, create and do what I love every single day. I think people only think those that write must be someone that writes stories and books or writes journal and newspaper articles. However, the characteristics of what defines who a  writer is can be fluid and free. With that being said, this web portfolio will walk you through a story about why the application Tik Tok can be seen as a dark hole due to its power to be addicting. The content shown rather, elaborates on who I am as a creator and a writer and how even though I work as a social media coordinator every day there are platforms I find rather unhealthy for people to spend long hours on. While you are scrolling through my portfolio, take the time to think about your social media consumption, specifically the time you spend on Tik Tok as a form of lesiure.</p>
                                
                               <p>Is it an unhealthy amount?</p>

<dt>Kelsey: (00:08)</dt>
<dd>Tik-Tok in my eyes has become the most addictive, amusing and one of the most influential apps on the internet. I see it as a massive dark hole, the second you open the app and start to scroll you get caught in what I like to call the Tik-Tok abyss (echoes and reverb used). </dd>
<br>   
<center>(Fade out Dark cinematic trailer music)</center>
<br>   
<dt>Kelsey: (00:22)</dt>
<dd>Not only is this application used for 30-60 second dancing videos</dd>
<br>
<dt>(00:26) (Sound effect from the app)</dt>
<dt>Kelsey: (00:29)</dt>
<dd>It’s an app used for singing, recipe ideas, traveling ideas, cool content and more</dd>
<br>
<dt> (00:33) (Sinking/Sound Declining). </dt>
<dt>Kelsey: (00:35 )</dt>
<dd>Did you hear that sound?</dd>
<br>

<br>                           
<dt>Kelsey: (00:38)</dt>
<dd>That’s what I mean you just sunk into the Tik Tok abyss I have been talking about. 
 I tend to find myself opening up Tik Tok and thinking okay I am going to give myself 10 minutes…

<center>(Fade Dark cinematic trailer music back in)</center>
<br>                       
<dt>Kelsey: (00:56)</dt>
<dd>And the next thing you know it’s been three hours and I am still lying in bed watching these internet videos. Then I think to myself wow I just watched approximately 300 different videos. I open Tik Tok and immediately get stuck on watching videos about cool new food recipes, the worst thing about that is, I don’t even like to cook.</dd>
<br>
<dt>(01:17) (Crowd Laughing)</dt>
<dt>Kelsey: (01:19)</dt>
<dd>Quite honestly though, I go on Tik Tok more often than not to pass the time. Whenever I am maybe waiting for my food in a microwave, or I am waiting for somebody to pick me up, or I am standing in line at the grocery store waiting to cash out. I flip open the app and begin to give my thumb a workout, by scrolling, and scrolling and scrolling.  This may sound a little bit introverted but coming from the perspective of an extrovert this is the dark black hole of being addicted to Tik-Tok that I am talking about. As extroverted as I may be, you will never catch me dancing to a Tik Tok song, mostly because I have two left feet when I dance.  I have thought about creating a Tik Tok account where I can show off my skills of graphic design ideas and how to tutorial videos but if I am being honest I don’t even know where I would start. You would think, someone that is an avid Tik Tok user would be able to know how to create but there’s no way! Maybe this is the black hole I was talking about, the app is so addictive but I don’t even know how to create</dd>
 <br>                          
<center>(Fade out Dark cinematic trailer music)</center>
<dt>Kelsey: (02:24)</dt>
<dd>All in all, people do find this app very toxic.</dd>
<br>
<center>(Storm cloud music begins)</center>
<dt>Kelsey: (02:28)</dt>
<dd>This is not only because of how addicting it is but simply because of the way it affects the mental health of many youth individuals. See, the problem with an app like this is that if you aren’t using it, joining in on the crazy challenges people are stating or creating on it, people then don’t think you are cool. As a hockey coach of a U18 female team, I hear the sentence quite often “coach come on, it’s all over TikTok” or “Oh I got this off of Tik Tok coach”, like really, I’m supposed to know everything being posted on that app? But then once I go home, and begin to scroll, and I catch myself thinking, oh I see what they are talking about, there I am, stuck, once again, in the Tik Tok abyss.</dd>
