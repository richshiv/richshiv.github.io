							<h2>Feature: Breaking Convention: Physical Thinking with William Forsythe</h2>
                            <p> May 2019 /feature essay for NBoC's live performance print program and Ballet+ online platform</p><br>
                          
                            <p> Excerpt:<i> “<strong>Approximate Sonata 2016</strong> wraps precision in a laissez faire attitude. It’s a deceptively casual series of linked duets, with movement that rapidly accumulates and layers like a multi-exposure photograph. Once again working with Thom Willems, Forsythe asks dancers to skim through unpredictable technical challenges as the music morphs in mood and tempo... In all three works, Forsythe combines an enthusiasm for legacy elements such as pointe work with radical phrasing and pace, torqued shapes and an absence of the gender specificities of many ballets, both traditional and contemporary.”</i></p>

							<h2>Feature: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Mess That is AI Image Generation</h2>
							<p>March 2023 / digital scholarship Demon Archives Project for WRIT3001 at York University</p><br>
                            <p> Excerpt:<i> “Most image generators work in the same general way. You fill in a text prompt, and the platform generates new image options using training sets of existing art (mostly scraped from an online database of images called LAION-5B) that have been diffused down to “noise”, then reassembled into something new...Experimentation with the language of text prompts and endlessly fine-tuning the results is strangely fun and satisfying.”</i></p>

							<h2>Essay: Migrating Meaning </h2> 
							<p>March 2023/ Collection Regards Hybrides</p>
                            <p>In addition to serving on the programming committee for Collection Regards Hybrides archive of dance on film and video, Kathleen contributed an online essay that explores the work of filmmaker and artist Laura Taler.</p>
                            <p>Excerpt: <i>“In much of Taler’s work, split emotional allegiances and a sense of displacement—the kind that remains long after settling into a new environment—evoke some of the instabilities of the immigrant experience... Eastern European heritage resonates in most of her work, tangentially with titling, settings, cos- tuming, and objects, or more specifically in location, song, and folk dance, as in the village trilogy and other dance and film works.”</i></p>

                            <p>Excerpt: <i>"An exceptional natural mover in a range of styles, November has nonetheless fully embraced the classical form. “It’s challenging in a way you can’t really get in any other dance form,” he says. But even with all the time and passion he invested training at NBS, November says that he never took a ballet career for granted. With his shorter stature (he’s now 5′ 7″) and his background, he wasn’t sure he could even have one: “For me, there was this idea that it wasn’t ever for someone like me."</i></p>

                            <p>Excerpt:<i> "Evann Siebens, an ex-dancer and accomplished cameraperson, rode the dancefilm wave in the ’90s. Siebens’ dance experience continues to colour her ideas about filmmaking: “In the filmmaking world, if you don’t storyboard, if you don’t have an entire film pre-visualized and drawn out, you’re seen as a ‘bad’ filmmaker,” she says. “In the contemporary dance world, if you come in with your dance completely written and storyboarded, then you’re seen as a ‘bad’ choreographer. ”</i></p>

                                ancient stereo plotter, then gathers pens to ink the topography. Pale green like the underbelly of a woodfern in spring for marshes, blue as a summer sky for hills, magenta for the hardscape infrastructure installed by the province. He notes that the boundaries have shrunk yet again. This must be his third major update in a decade.
                                The map maker remembers the original survey, walking the Manito Miikana trail with Edie, the views of the Pic River and its dunes to the North, glimpses of Lake Superior to the west.  He had surveyed most of the great unbroken swathe of the boreal forest; back then it ran from the Labrador coast to the Alaskan out islands dotting the Bering Sea."</i></p>
